Timestamp	What were your honest first impressions of coming across a manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto? Was it CSM or Fire Punch or a one-shot? What did you think of it? Was it cool, dumb, weird, funny, amazing, garbage?
7/4/2022 16:35:30	test
7/4/2022 16:37:27	(CSM) It was surreal. It was my first real manga ever, and I was blown away. The incredible details, that not overbearing humor, the gore, it's just become this amazing new medium I can enjoy because of him.
7/4/2022 16:38:32	It was CSM... it was so fast so frenetic and intense I just thought wow that is for me!!!
7/4/2022 16:39:29	Gay
7/4/2022 16:40:15	chainsaw man had me on the verge of ejaculation
7/4/2022 16:40:48	The first manga I read from Fujimoto was CSM which was also the first manga I’ve read and still my favourite, after that I read Fire Punch and that brought out emotions I didn’t even know I had, I’ve been loving his recent one shots and the best way to describe his writing is that it’s an experience. 
7/4/2022 16:42:12	CSM, addictive 
7/4/2022 16:42:57	csm:i actually started reading it because a friend recommended it to me but you see the exact next day was when the anime got announced so i decided I'll put tge manga on hold and just watch the anime but in the few chapters i did read i saw the most amazing shit I have ever seen in my life
7/4/2022 16:44:50	Chainsaw Man. I thought it seemed interesting and I thought Pochita was cute so I decided to read it and got hooked really quickly, loved it, and ended up going through the whole thing in just a few days.
7/4/2022 16:45:05	I haven’t read any of his works, but have heard so much good things from you, and many other influencers and people online. I’m really excited to see CSM in anime form.
7/4/2022 16:46:11	I had Chainsaw Man recommended to me (I think by Eyepatch Wolf) and read through all of it in 2 sittings. I thought it was a fantastic manga and among the best I've read. I've seen few stories where a plot twist is pulled off so fantastically. I then went on to check out his recent one-shots, Look Back and Goodbye, Eri, which were extremely resonant as someone who enjoys creating art. I recently re-read them both and caught so much more the second time around. I love the message of art making connections between people and bringing out the best in them. I'll always remember the page where Fujino thinks about all the negatives of creating manga only for the page to end with a panel of Kyomoto's infectious smile.  Fujimoto's one of the greats imo, up there with Oda, Muira, and Araki.
7/4/2022 16:46:24	Heard a lot about chainsaw man & people hyping it up, I went into it thinking it was gonna be some average generic shounen but it happened to be one of my favourite mangas of all time
7/4/2022 16:47:14	Chainsaw Man. Cool, weird, funny, amazing, exciting, sad, confusing, horny. This manga took me places it was pretty fun.
7/4/2022 16:48:03	CSM. It was cool, weird, and dumb in a good at the same time. I'm really hyped for the next part to start, and I should probably read his other works sometime soon. 
7/4/2022 16:48:26	Crazy and nonsensical but amazing and somehow thought provoking at the same time.
7/4/2022 16:49:09	cool dumb ana amazing 
7/4/2022 16:49:19	Cool, weird, and funny
7/4/2022 16:51:04	I came across Fire Punch and decided to read it because the cover looked really cool. Initially I was hooked by how strong the plot seemed, the incest and constant sexual assault was a little weird, but the author is Japanese, so he probably doesn't know what regular sex is, so I let it slide. Up until halfway through the manga I was having a good time. The main character seemed a little remedial, but mf kinda burned to death for 8 years so it made sense. The transgender girl obsessed with movies was hard carrying the manga, but then...  after the fight in the city... The author must have ran out of fucking Adderall or gotten into a car accident or something, because Fire Punch spirals from being a good manga into a man phoning it in every week and writing the first thing that came to his mind. You know when celebrities fall off and people think they have been replaced by clones. Yeah, it wouldn't shock me if the author was cloned, because its hard to believe that the same person wrote the two halves of the story. The manga got so bad that I wanted the main character to go back and start fucking his sister again, it would have been a better read. W scam, W tax evasion, L manga, Fuck Titsaki Funjiminto or whatever, I'm not reading Chainsaw Man, deepthroat my balls. - NB
7/4/2022 16:51:29	It was CSM (i caught up at chapter 50), then FP. I thought it was raw af.
7/4/2022 16:51:51	Fire punch was my first Fujimoto work, the first thought I had after reading the first chapter was "nah please don't fuck your sister" but after that my first impressions were a cool, fun ,very RAW AND CHAOTIC style
7/4/2022 16:53:53	I thought Chainsaw Man was a bold title, this guy must have something interesting. I was right, but also surprised at almost every turn. And the art is rough in a beautiful way.
7/4/2022 16:55:27	The first manga I read from fujimoto was ChainsawMan. Out of everything Ive read csm is by far my favourite. Its immersive, gory but goofy, it presents the characters in a way that makes you love them, it complicates and normalizes death while also giving each one more depth than other anime/manga (for example, and you can blur this spoiler out,Akis death) , and it has pochita. I could write a whole book on it, but this is just a really short representation of my feelings on it. Pluto out✌
7/4/2022 16:55:56	I picked up Chainsaw Man on the recommendation of the manga community following my enjoyment of JJK and Hell's Paradise. I feel that though Fujimoto is incredibly versatile in his writing style with a great grasp of how to visualize literary themes and his desired symbolism. Fujimoto struggles with always grasping a sane plot line (looking at you Fire Punch) and tends to maybe run unrestrained against the will of his editors. His side cast in the terms of CSM are under-developed and because of his desired pacing being that of a quick run it leaves people as perhaps unfinished. I believe his one-shots may be forcing him to work more on developing characters past just basic motivation. For now, I feel that his depraved ideas and unmatched imagination that leads to beautiful paneling and story beats harms his overall narrative in the same breathe. 
7/4/2022 16:56:32	Okay I haven’t read chainsaw man yet and I plan to soon. But I tried to read fire punch one time. And with the first chapter being …. How it is. I stopped reading it cuz of the incest and crazy parts of it. I also wasn’t a fan of his art style in the fire punch first couple chapters. But his works are crazy over the top in a good way(with how gore-y they are). 
7/4/2022 16:58:47	I got the official printed Viz Media Volumes of Chainsaw Man.  Got about half of them at the time since the rest weren't localized in English yet.  Sadly I couldn't wait for them to come out and read the rest online and it was one of the best shonen mangas I've read.  I recently have most of the volumes now so I may go back to reread all of part 1 since it is such a good series.  I really like the comedy and the nonstop action set pieces Fujimoto put into Chainsaw Man.  Part 1 really wraps itself up nicely by the end as well.  Feels complete when you finish it but it also leaves some plot points to pick up in part 2.  Eagerly awaiting part 2 right now.  I read Goodbye Eri and Look Back shortly after I finished Chainsaw Man and they were really good one shots.  The most I can really say about them is that they're full of heart and meaning.  I loved them.  Fire Punch I haven't read yet, but it's on my manga list so I'll get to it eventually.
7/4/2022 16:59:58	I remember reading fire punch's beginning and thinking it was the most fucked up shit ever. Justifiable cannibalism, dictatorships with a literal power of burning their enemys forever, A DUDE WHO MAKES SLAVES HAVE SEX WITH DOGS. It definitely isn't for everybody, but i think everyone should give it a shot. Behind every fucked up thing there's a message he tries to convey, be it a critic on modern society's flaws or just how much he wants to be stepped on by a hot dom woman 
7/4/2022 17:01:44	My first introduction Tatsuki Fujimoto was Chainsaw Man and funilly enough it was also my very first manga and I thought it was fucking bombastically weirdly amazingly good and then I read Fire Punch which I liked the ending confused me but still liked it and the recent one shots he's done were peak writing peak fiction so so good.
7/4/2022 17:01:55	I first read CSM. It was such a big difference to any other manga/anime I’ve read/watched ever in the best way possible. 
7/4/2022 17:02:34	My first was chainsaw man, and i thought it was incredibly over the top, weird, but charming in a way. The ending blow my mind, but for me it was the newer one shots that perfected fujimoto´s style, pacing and paneling, and i fucking love it
7/4/2022 17:03:52	My first manga I read by Fujimoto was Chainsaw man. I remember the series just started and was already gaining popularity chapter by chapter, after a handful of chapters I wanted to give It a try because there were people already praising this series and It really interested me to see whats it about. So i started reading It weekly for about 2-3 months. I was already in love with Chainsaw man, so I did what i usually do with other manga, manhwa, anime that are not finished, I waited until the story was done. So, almost 2 years have passed and I go on twitter just to be surprised that the manga was announced to end in a few chapters, so I go and read It. The whole thing, not one single arc, not one single chapter not even one single panel was boring or uninteresting, everything about It was just what I expected from the few chapters I read at the beginning. So by the time I finished CSM I was interested in the author, Tatsuki Fujimoto, so I searched him and found some older works he has done before CSM, Look Back and Fire Punch. Because I was so interested in his writing style I began to read Look Back seeing It was just a oneshot. It blew me away just as he did with CSM. After that I took to read Fire Punch, I was a bit hesitant because this was his first manga that he wrote, I still gave It a shot.I read about 15 chapters, and while it shows that this is his first manga, its still a lot better than the average popular shonen. Of course when I heard he was dropping another one shot this year, Goodbye, Eri, I was absolutely hyped and excited to see what he prepared for us, and without a doubt, this Is it, another 10/10 series (in my opinion) along with CSM and Look Back. Right now, Tatsuki Is one of my favorite mangaka, and depending how good CSM part2 will be he might take the number 1 spot. Sorry for writing this whole paragraph. I am definitely looking forward to seeing how CSM will continue and very excited for other projects he has to give us.
7/4/2022 17:04:10	The first thing I read by Fujimoto was CSM in very early 2021. I found it through chance on Shonen Jump and fucking loved it. Very cool and very amazing👍
7/4/2022 17:04:55	Odd
7/4/2022 17:05:24	Fire Punch was my first Fujimoto manga. It was recommended to me by a friend and he recommended it to me on the sole basis that God/Religion/Mass Cultural beliefs are a theme of the story. When I first started, I found it mildly interesting. But I continued along because it was still just interesting enough. When Togata was introduced, I read solely for her. Then things started going more and more insane and I was HOOKED. I love the themes in Fire Punch. I love the ending. It still affects me. I love the crass sense of humour coupled with the deep themes.
7/4/2022 17:06:12	CSM, it was amazing and weird but in a good way, something very few things I read managed to accomplish.
7/4/2022 17:06:31	My first impressions of Tatsuki Fujimoto were from Chainsaw Man, and after reading the manga I thought that he was in someways a genius and in other ways batshit crazy. The absurdity of his work was great for the story telling purposes. Yet even with all of the absurdity in the story the characters still felt almost real, and with any of the characters being able to die added to this.
7/4/2022 17:09:08	cool, dumb, weird, amazing
7/4/2022 17:10:19	He slowly grew on me. My first impressions of him were on  Fire Punch and Chainsaw Man. Fire Punch, I didn't really understand it at first but I slowly started to like it and I couldn’t put it down and Chainsaw Man was just relatable because of the goals Denji set for himself ( and being a recent high school grad ) and add in the interesting characters, designs and world and I was hooked. 
7/4/2022 17:18:41	When reading csm it was quite the different feel from other manga l have read before, how l mean it is that is kind of relatable in the sense of wanting to be loved and the first 10 or 11 chapters where good funny to be honest and at chapter 10 or 11 was able to touch Power’s mama bags and when he did as you know he was disappointed, dissatisfied and of course one chapter after we go to the real mama bags Makima that moment was interesting he was able to touch someone intimate and also is some he loves.  From reading chapter 1 to chapter 97 where amazing. From the joy of just seeing Pochita to laughing at Kobeni’s suffering and of course the best waifu Kobeni’s car. These where some of the high moments of csm which made adore it and of there are those moments when l just hear the words of SNOWBALL Fight those words l just want to cry. Thank you Tastsuki Fujimoto for tormenting our feelings and ruining childhood stuff like snowball fight thank you lol l just to cry.  But honestly chainsaw man is just really amazing. Reading fire punch and the person that help Tastsuki Fujimoto and that person hell’s paradise still just half way done with that and is quite insane and interesting l feel a sense of Tastsuki Fujimoto which makes me laugh.   All of Tastsuki Fujimoto’s stories or the people that help him are all really good stories is just amazing. Idk what to say now l am just going to repeat myself now so yeah he is a monster a beast that will not forgotten for a while 
7/4/2022 17:20:11	Pretty weird for something in SJ, ig.
7/4/2022 17:21:07	First manga was Chainsaw Man. It was chaotic with a hint of madness (okay, "a hint" might be an understatement, that shit was balls deep insanity) with pacing that had me questioning if Barry Allen was working on it. Yet for some reason unbeknownst to me, I fucking dig it because of that absurdly fast-pacing, plus the adrenaline pumping action scenes. Also man's not afraid of doing certain things that most people would consider jarring and I respect him for that as well. The unpredictability of his manga subverts most of my expectations and I really love it when I get smacked across the head with something completely different to what I hypothesised, that's typically the case with most of Tatsuki Fujimoto's manga for me. 
7/4/2022 17:21:10	His work on Chainsawman is so incredibly written, impressing visualy and well done in every aspect in humour, sadness,happiness,importance of things,and the morals with the end where denji is finally free and have to take Care of someone is so stunning. I personnaly think that it has had a impact incredible on my way to think and the way I used to draw, it's so realistic and satiric and impredictable.  Like the famous vomit scene, the death of characters, the type of people, hell, the true meaning of makima, the lesbian girls, power's death, the representation of aki's death witch seem to be inspired from all the movies he watched and thé fact that it's from denji. It's also great to think if the questions liké every questions in every mangas but to really making denji reacting in an egocentrist way is super reversing, and more when it's after the only girls to be exploit at the fullest in the manga tell him that he's not normal IS suprising. It's so great to have characters taliing honestly in a manga and i Hope people will Make surprising manga like this.(Dandadan is great i know you repas it too). I Guess his shit as he say is pretty cool, and his works on others stuffs too.  My english is not that good sorry and i can't wait for part 2.  
7/4/2022 17:21:28	I first read fire punch at 9 years old, fucking big mistake, I dropped it in 1 chapter cause my only after I was traumatized. Recently got back into it after reading chainsaw man and that was a fucking ride. 10/10 story. I'm not gay but if fujimoto asked to hit, you know I'm butt booty naked already lubed up ready for him.
7/4/2022 17:24:24	At first it was chainsaw man and I didn’t had any hope for it I thought it going to be good but never expected to be such a masterpiece. fujimoto just slapped me cause of how incredible chainsaw man is. That why I think fujimoto is genius. Also sorry for bad english 
7/4/2022 17:26:12	The first work that i encountered from fugimoto was Fire Punch i haven't finished it yet (should do so after writing this ) but to this day i have never forgotten how raw & primal(?) the characters and events that happened in the manga felt, it was interesting and different i could feel the crazy side in the series and that attracted me. i encountered CSM couple years later and realized it was the same author so i decided to read it to see whether or not the author crazy side and approach to storytelling had changed or not and it didn't and i respect that, fugimoto is a good mangaka and storyteller he hasn't reached god tier yet but the guy loves what he is creating and it shows in his works and that makes a story feel genuine, so yea fugimoto is GOAT.
7/4/2022 17:28:20	Ayo, it’s Mr reaction streamer! I first found his work out through a youtube video about chainsaw man, it was just at the release of the final chapter and for some unknown reason I decided to watch a video that talked about a story I hadn’t read. I sadly got spoiled about the reveal of the gun devil, at the time, I didn’t think much of it, now I am fucking pissed. I decided to read the story since I had a job at the time which had hours of waiting between work. So I read it, and I haven’t been as entertained by a manga period. The amazing art, story and most importantly the jokes! At first I felt like the story was more comedy than drama, which was fine by me, yet as it kept going I found myself invested in every character, in what happened to them and how everything would end up for them. I got to the end and since I had gotten spoiled I was pissed because I knew who was answering that door at the end and the emotions I would've felt weren’t there. Either way the story was a 10/10 and I plan on reading his other works soon.   Idk regards? Cybe Things aka Cybe Reviews aka Famous swedish actor Moses Ternedal. 
7/4/2022 17:29:54	Dumb, pure genius and chaos. I love it. The scene where they play beach ball with a decapitated head in fire punch is my fav to this day. 
7/4/2022 17:30:15	I decided i would read both look back and goodbye eri as they were pretty short. My god was I suprised when i had basically found the best one shots i have read thus far. What really struck me about them was the masterful panelling and engaging story. Goodbye Eri is effortlessly in my top 20 even though it's so short. The twists and turns the story took had me in shock. I plan on reading both fire punch and chainsaw man in the future as I was thoroughly impressed by what Tatsuki Fujimoto offered in so few pages.
7/4/2022 17:30:37	My first work of his was Fire punch, when CSM wasn't even published yet, when I first read it, it hooked me instantly with its uses of immortality, its grim story and art style and its sense of humor, I read it to the end, then after word, kept up with CSM published chapter after published chapter, btw his other small unknown works like Goodbye eri or Look back were incredible
7/4/2022 17:31:33	Chainsaw Man was my introduction to his work. His action scenes are fantastic and characters are very unique! However I’ll admit his work isn’t perfect but I still enjoy it quite a bit. And this is coming from the perspective of reading Chainsaw Man, Fire Punch, Look Back and Goodbye Eri.
7/4/2022 17:31:44	csm as reccomended by a couple of people including my best friend. while reading it i was bewildered but entertained at the same time since it followed the usual story structure i enjoy the most (eg tg:re, naruto and jigokuraku) closely enough for the weirdness to make it better rather than worse.
7/4/2022 17:32:03	The first manga I read was Chainsaw Man and I thought that it had a lot of character, and I found myself becoming extremely interested in the relationships of all the characters.
7/4/2022 17:33:19	I don’t have deep thoughta while reading manga it’s either I like it or I don’t like it and I loved chainsaw man
7/4/2022 17:36:25	Came across CSM from a youtuber who was certain that it would be a mega hit. I loved it from the beginning to the end. It was unpredictable, sometimes it was pure chaos. I loved the chapters with no dialogue and only fighting at end. Also read fire punch, which made me cry at end
7/4/2022 17:49:27	Amazing and intriguing because I’ve never seen a shonen like it 
7/4/2022 17:54:27	Chainsaw Man was my first work of his that I've read.  I thought it was crazy awesome at first and then once stuff went REALLY crazy, it was reminding me of End of Evangelion in terms of how batshit insane it got towards the end of the manga.  Actually just read Fire Punch, Look Back and Goodbye, Eri this past week and honestly, Fujimoto is a GENIUS.
7/4/2022 18:06:27	Csm and it 10/10 then read his one shots and those where all 10/10 as well 
7/4/2022 18:06:40	My first Tatsuki Fujimoto manga was Chainsaw Man. I've never been a fan of shounen because I usually find it predictable and repetitive, but the instant I picked up Chainsaw Man I knew it was gonna blow my mind! I binged through the whole series in two days and immediately did some reasearch on Tatsuki Fujimoto for more content to absorb :)
7/4/2022 18:07:02	Honestly when i first read the fire punch it was pretty good, i could almost feel the action and the feeling behind the art and the story, but one thing that got me pretty disturbed, it was the canninalism and incest part. Even though there was an event when his sister ended up dying but somehow he just cant move on and still obsessed with her.  Also, i like the part where someone can change themself in the story no matter who they are.
7/4/2022 18:09:35	My first impression was the CSM manga earlier this year. My ADD brain instantly clicked with the fast paced paneling and storytelling. It was both hilarious and shocking in all the right ways. The world and characters are put together with a lot of care that is clear from the first few arcs. It doesn't overstay its welcome and brings a satisfying conclusion, leaving me in anticipation for the next part. 
7/4/2022 18:09:51	I loved Fire Punch because although it didn't have as much comedy as CSM, it had all the twists and turns that we love Tatsuki Fujimoto for. Anytime I get into a conversation about CSM, I always be sure to bring up Fire Punch and Tatsuki Fujimoto's oneshots
7/4/2022 18:09:58	My first exposure to Tatsuki Fujimoto’s work was Chainsaw Man like so many other people. When I first read it I liked it a lot but didn’t think too much of it, it was just some dumb goofy fun. A couple months later I ended up having the urge to read it again and absolutely fell in love with it. I then immediately read Look Back, then Fire Punch and by the time Goodbye Eri came out I had reread all of his series multiple times. I realised that all of his series just have a certain rawness and authenticity to it that really appeals to me, it felt so distinctly different from other Shonen stories in a way that was really refreshing.
7/4/2022 18:13:18	My first experience with Fujimoto Sensei was with Chainsaw Man, and while that is one of my favorite mangas of all time, Goodbye Eri hit me harder than anything I ever read, the drawings are so beautiful and recognizable, the conversations between characters come off so naturally, just like you're actually watching two people on their day to day business, the writing is also amazing, it paces itself perfectly, knows when to accelerate, slow down and hit ya with a good'ol plot twist, reading Fujimoto is way more than reading manga, it's like, experiencing a real life occurrence, and it's so so so so so good and enjoyable to read, and I think Goodbye Eri is the is the most emersive and probably the best piece of writing I have ever set my eyes on.
7/4/2022 18:15:28	I read Fire Punch. didn't finish it but read like 60~ chapters. I thought it was kinda nice and the concept was like generic and very very unique at the same time, I really really loved the art style, very unique.  It did start to get boring though; you can see he tried making every step of the journey unique and enjoyable (at least in my opinion) but what made this story boring for me is that even through all the plot twists and cool things happening, the vibe itself almost never changed (not like other mangas are different, except like vinland saga for example) and when it did, it quickly went back.  If I were to take anything about this manga on the author himself, I'd immediately bring up this vibe that the whole story had, it's really hard to put into words but I can just feel it, strongly in each and every chapter, page and even panel of him.  sorry if this impression wasn't the most helpful (It's like 4am for me rn) but I hope you can understand at least a bit of what I meant.
7/4/2022 18:17:33	My first thing I read by him was chainsaw man. I like the character designs I think he was inspired from Abara with the chainsaw man. Also I read look away  
7/4/2022 18:17:34	Hm well for me , it started with chainsaw man but at first , i was very critical of it but i gave it a try Because i heard all the good things about it and all the hype surrounding it & so i checked out his other works like fire punch and his one-shots and i gotta say , its impressive and it probably one of the coolest manga ive ever read , its a 6.5/10 for me .
7/4/2022 18:23:23	I had a blast reading all of Tatsuki Fujimoto's one-shots in one day, and reread several of them often! Goodbye Eri blew my mind. It's definitely my favorite and I'd love for it to get an anime movie adaptation or something like that. Look Back was just saddd but I enjoyed looking into the life of manga authors, as well as the unique situations the characters faced. His first one with the chickens wasn't the best to read, but it had it's funny moments and shocking twists. Shikaku was hilarious and heartwarming. I'd love to see a slice-of-life manga with just the everyday lives of these two. Little Sister's Elder Sister was the first one-shot of his that I read, and even though it was a little (vine boom) I had a blast reading it and just adore the ending. All of Fujimoto's one-shots are masterpieces to me, but these one's definitely stood out the most.
7/4/2022 18:29:32	My first manga from him was fire punch and I loved it so much I read it in a day. 
7/4/2022 18:29:47	When I first started CSM I thought it was just a comedy but near the end it almost made me cry,
7/4/2022 18:32:18	i’ve been buying and immediately reading every chainsaw man volume since the first, and i really enjoyed the betrayal as well as the realism that he shows in the personalities of his characters. i picked up fire punch volume 1 recently, but i haven’t read it yet, and i’m looking into some of his one shots. from my experiences with him on social platforms, he really likes food. really fucking likes food. anyway, he has a huge amount of potential as an author and is throwing out masterpiece after masterpiece, and i look forward to chainsaw man part 2.
7/4/2022 18:34:06	CSM was an amazing experience, which led me to fire punch..... which was an experience to say the least. Fire Punch left me feeling weird.
7/4/2022 18:34:10	I first came across Chainsawman while looking at the shonen jump app for a new manga to read since I just finished my first manga (Demon Slayer). I thought it sounded cool so I started reading it and I thought it was pretty cool and funny, but by the time I caught up to the current chapter at the time (around chapter 85) it was clear to me that this was something special. Reading the last 15-ish chapters weekly is still, to this day, the best weekly manga experience ive ever had (followed closely by Dandadan). When Chainsawman part 1 ended and they announced part 2 and the anime, I had genuinely never been as hyped before as I was that day. A little while later I read Fire Punch which was amazing at the start but the last few volumes were only kinda meh to me. Later I decided to re-read Chainsawman again and I loved it even more that time! It became my second favorite manga (which it still is) only behind Jojo. Later I read his Nayuta oneshot and another oneshot. They were good. Look Back was AMAZING so after  it came out I decided to read all of his oneshots (which are all worth reading) Goodbye Eri instantly became my favorute oneshot when that came out. Fujimoto is tied with Araki as my favorite mangaka of all time. All of his manga mean a lot to me. Ive read through Chainsawman 4 times and it gets better everytime! I AM SO HYPED FOR THE PART 2 PREMEIRE NEXT WEEK!!!!
7/4/2022 18:46:10	It was CSM. The very first page enticed me, specifically because the line about how the main character sold one of his testicles made me giggle. I continued reading and caught up quickly since there was only 3 chapters. I began keeping up weekly and, before long, it became my favorite piece of fiction ever and Fujimoto became my favorite writer.
7/4/2022 18:49:53	My first Tatsuki Fujimoto manga was CSM, I had heard some good things about it and the dude on the front over was cool so I checked it out. I ended up finishing it that day and was only left with a mixture of awe, confusion, and excitement for what would come next. So far i have read CSM, Fire Punch, and Goodbye, Eri; with all of these works making him one of my all time favorites up there with Berserk's Kentaro Miura and Monster's Naoki Urusawa. Long story short, I think he's fucking great. (Btw I think you're videos are criminaly underrated and deserve more recognition, keep up the good shit).
7/4/2022 18:55:03	CSM; I thought it was amazing. The concept of a Shonen being that dark, gory, and heartbreaking has never crossed my mind. Of course it still has the troupes of most shonen, but I believe it to be the best 97 chapter manga I’ve ever read. 
7/4/2022 19:03:02	My first manga by Fujimoto was chainsaw man. I had heard of fire punch but I never tried to read it. Even the first time I read chainsaw man, I thought the manga was so cool and I made it read to all of my friends. It had only 10ich chapters at that time. 
7/4/2022 19:05:09	Fujimoto stunned me with how hilarious and action packed Chainsaw Man was. Then I decided to read Fire Punch, and that stunned me. Then I read his one shots as they were published, and each time I was blown away at how that man writes.
7/4/2022 19:05:38	Chainsaw man this shit was just fucking unhinged 💯💯
7/4/2022 19:12:27	I had heart a lot about chainsaw man before I read it. Heard it was quite good and I had very high expectations. Read it in a day and it somehow topped my expectations. Csm is the perfect short shounen. From the story to the beautiful art and choreography is perfect imo. Characters were sooo fuckin good. I literally liked every character. They were also amazingly developed for such a short manga. It became my number one manga at the time I read it (I haven't read much good/acclaimed mantas) but recently Oyasumi Punpun has topped it
7/4/2022 19:13:29	Got recd CSM by Scamboli I think and I went in not having read manga in YEARS. Shit blew me away. Gorgeous art. Great charecters (fuck spelling). Anyway first impression was a thumbs up. Goodbye Eri got some tears outta me at work which was fun I guess. Hasn’t happened since I read Flowers for Algernon in like Highschool.   Tl;dr: First impression good
7/4/2022 19:18:06	Chainsaw Man Chapter 21
7/4/2022 19:28:31	Chainsaw Man. Great read. My favourite of his work so far is Goodbye Eri.
7/4/2022 19:34:28	First thing I read from him (like most I’m sure) was Chainsaw Man.  I absolutely loved it.  I thought it was both the most batshit, deranged thing ever while also being one of the most clever and well thought out stories I’d seen in a while.  After going off to read Fire Punch and Look Back (haven’t gotten around to his other one shots but I will) he’s become one of my favorite mangaka’s working today. 
7/4/2022 19:43:00	CSM was the first piece of work I’ve seen from him. And it was Amazing, funny and weird he definitely has his own unique style to his work of art and storytelling. I believe even though his work is already blowing up even more now it’s gonna become Iconic and a big staple once the anime of CSM drops. I’ve started reading Fire punch as well and really love the heavily emotional weight of it. Cant wait to continue part 2 of the CSM manga. 
7/4/2022 19:50:01	i heard of chainsaw man first, but i finished fire punch first honestly i couldn't really compute anything other than the batshit insane story and set pieces but it didn't take long for me to realize that the whole story is a huge metaphor for depression and stuff and the story didn't really stuck with me until i slept on it for a few days but overall i liked it alot the wackass characters and all the emotional beats worked really well
7/4/2022 19:52:32	CSM, its cool and has a very simple story, but it lacks the one thing I always look for on stories the most "Development" and "Worldbuilding" in short it lacks DYNAMISM, sure it has some small developments here and there but I can't shake off the feeling of the Flatness in it, nevertheless its still a Cool and Great manga
7/4/2022 19:57:03	I read fire punch volume 1 first. Felt weird. Didn't continue with it. Read all of chainsaw man twice since then. Still waiting on fire punch restocks to pick it back up. 
7/4/2022 19:58:25	I loved it, the little dialogue and how well structured the panels are and the fast pace of each chapter
7/4/2022 19:58:28	My first impression that I had coming across a manga by him was that the art work was amazing. The first manga that I read from him was CSM and I think it was cool, dumb and weird in some parts, funny and amazing 
7/4/2022 20:09:46	CSM was the first Fujimoto work I read. i heard many good things about it so i had high expectations, although i didnt know what to expect. at the time i was reading it, i was fucking obsessed with it. it was so cool so crazy so fresh from what i usually read
7/4/2022 20:16:04	Obviously, most of us knew about Fujimoto from CSM and all the hype built around it before Spy Family just absorbed most of it. I was planning on watching the anime before reading that anime and when a friend of mine shared a panel where it was just 3 pages based on a conversation between Agni and Togata and thought it was kinda of experimental, compelling and might I say even bold. That's how I got introduced to Fujimoto.  When I came around to reading Fire Punch I couldn't be more amazed by the underlying narratives that drive most of the characters between the extreme cultist understanding of religion to the twisted wisdom of those that lived for more than a century all tied together within Sun and Judah's (as well as Togata) character arc respectively and don't get me started with Doma. It's a story that encompasses a bold social commentary.  The underlying issues I have had with the story is perhaps that it was too short and never delved into the nuances with regards to characters such as the ice witch and Doma's family members. But given the experimental nature of the story I didn't mind any of these issues. (Perhaps something that would be expanded upon on CSM).  It's a shame that I really can't give a broader scope or review on a manga author that I taken a liking towards (Alongside Urusawa, Asano and Oshimi). I'm very new to manga started 6 months ago after getting very tired of anime and got introduced to Oyasumi Punpun (NOT A GOOD FIRST MANGA BUT HOLY SHIT).  If there's something more I wanna say I just wanna tell you that I'm very glad your content has recently gained traction and you are an amazing content creator that deserves all the attention. Keep up the good work, College Sucks and enjoy life man. Peace out  -MEH KING  
7/4/2022 20:28:38	i thought wow this guy is a genius after finishing chainsaw man then i read every single other one shot he did and loved them all its just so weird bizarre in a good way 
7/4/2022 20:39:53	Csm was the first and it was funny, amazing, and just all around brilliant writing, combine with amazing visuals and very compelling and realistic characters.
7/4/2022 20:50:10	Amazing 
7/4/2022 20:55:45	The first thing I read of his work was Fire Punch and I had a very odd experience. By the first few chapters I thought the premise was completely ridiculous because of how extreme it went with its dark themes so quickly. But I felt that it was worth it to keep reading just based on how unique the art style was. When I reached the point where the main villian gives their motivations speech, I was in such utter disbelief from what I read I searched for other people's reactions and discussions about it to see if I had just read a trolly fan's translation of it. Once I had reached the end of story I felt mildy satisfied from what I read, but later on it felt like it was pretty amazing thinking back on how it started.
7/4/2022 21:03:08	The first manga that i read from Tatsuki Fujimoto was chainsaw man, i was looking for manga recomandations, and saw a video called something like "the mos brutal shonen jump manga" i got interested, after the video i went straight to read the manga. If im not wrong it was one of my first manga, like in the first 5, and i like it, i finished it in a day, because it was interesting. But after a while i randomlly saw a manga called fire punch, it was at a mall, i saw it on a shelf, when i lookt at the cover, idk why but my first tought was "this must be some gay manga" . But at home i did some research and found out that is from the same authour from chainsaw man. I tried to read it, and dropped it after some chapters it was to muc for me, but eventually I got back to it, and what to say, it made me cry, the personajes where there realistic, with realistic problems, u care about them, and the finale was so beatifull, so yeah, now Fujimoto is one of my favorite authours and im looking forwoard to see hes future works. Btw every year I come back at "fire punch." And re-read it, and it never fails to impres me. And im sorry for all the gramatical shot ive done there.
7/4/2022 21:03:15	CSM, all of those except garbage none of it is garbage  its... surreal is the best I can do
7/4/2022 21:07:50	My first experience with Fujimoto was Sayonara Eri, his most recent work before Chainsaw man part 2. Prior to reading, I was well aware of the hype and attention he has garnered over the years as an up and coming mangaka. Thus, i went in with pretty high expectations. To say my expectations were surpassed is an understatement. Sayonara Eri was and is one of the most special pieces of storytelling i’ve EVER read across all mediums. It was a story that resonated with me due to the themes it addresses such as death, loss, and the ability to overcome tragedy. It’s an emotionally driven story that touches on the fragilest aspects of our lives. It shows how easy things can change tomorrow, how we should cherish the present, and to appreciate people while they are still with us because they won’t be forever. I should also mention im not one for these types of melancholic and emotional stories. I much prefer typical shonen, turn off your brain type manga where it’s just two characters going at it over the highest of world shattering stakes. However, Sayonara Eri was special in that i was able to walk away knowing its message and knowing it conveyed that message in a manner that was effective/masterfully executed. Even if you aren’t one for finding the “deeper meaning” in stories, Sayonara Eri shows that message through its amazing artwork as there is minimal reading in the entire one shot. It’s super clear in the story and message it wants to tell. Needless to say, i rushed to read Chainsaw man and it is amazing as well
7/4/2022 21:19:13	csm it was good because power boobs
7/4/2022 21:22:26	It was csm like most but the most recent were his two new one shots and let me tell you. He has such a way of reeling you in and hooking you right off the bat. he doesn’t have to be blatant with his meaning for you to undertand he also leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and his art style is one of my favorite  and I think that he has so much room to become one of the best out there if he develops more. He doesn’t have mind blowing art work like kentaro miura or junji ito but the way he has his ways to make you love a character who you hated at first or makes you think one thing to then find out it was completely the opposite and leave you clues to find it your self that when you look back it all makes sense 
7/4/2022 21:23:44	it was csm for me. seeing denji's character was honestly kind of a shock because man he is down TREMENDOUSLY bad, but it was almost kind of endearing in how earnest he was about his feelings, and that sucked me into csm right away. not to mention the art style is FIRE, so yeah. to put simply, fujimoto's work was kind of entrancing-- everything felt so well thought out that i got sucked in right away.
7/4/2022 21:28:33	My first impression was just amazement. My friend recommended chainsawman ro me and I finished it in 2 days. Ever since then even though it isn't my favorite, I've had a weird connection with it. Also, just started reading Fire Punch, so we'll see what I think of it. 😁
7/4/2022 21:42:37	His only work I’ve read so far is his one-shot goodbye eri and I genuinely enjoyed it I found it confusing, weird, funny, heartfelt it brought out a lot of emotion in me in just 200 pages and I personally think it’s amazing.
7/4/2022 21:52:52	fire punch, it was weird. the premise was good but as the story went on it made less and less sense and was just bunch of random events
7/4/2022 22:29:19	I thought it was just really good fun at first and then as I saw other people taking it more seriously I realized that maybe he had more to his writing. I also remember really liking his art, the architecture in particular
7/4/2022 22:29:53	Also i forgot to say and idk if u can tell who responded but I was talking about csm
7/4/2022 22:32:49	My first tatsuki manga was fire punch and the thing that really pulled me in was the incest, as a guy who loves incest I had to continue reading it and I actually liked it a lot 10/10 would read again, it is an amazing manga imp   Also could you try to pronounce aryavardhan lmfao 
7/4/2022 22:36:34	Chainsawman and I loved it. Now I own all 11 volumes.
7/4/2022 22:36:52	It was CSM. At first it was weird but also super interesting. After that it was just amazing. It is now one of if not my favorite manga.
7/4/2022 22:42:48	CSM. It was chaotic fun, crazy ass plot & ride. I'd say it is.. The most rollercoasterish journey ive had.. In any medium that i have tried. (Sorry for the bad english, not a native) 
7/4/2022 22:43:02	My first manga I read of his was chainsaw man. Weirdly enough it helped me through a dark period of time I was in. I guess it gave me a sense of confidence in myself after seeing (spoilers) a boy with nothing turning into a hero that people can count on. I love the manga for many reasons but that is a big one. I will truly never forget chainsaw man and how much fujimoto helped me through that dark time I was in. THANK YOU FUJIMOTO. Btw fire punch and his one shots all are also really good.
7/4/2022 22:46:29	First impressions was like "damn this art is fire" The first manga I read period was CSM and it's absolute fire no explanation needed like I'm sitting here rn like damn I wanna read CSM 2
7/4/2022 22:58:17	The first one I read was Fire Punch but I learned about him through Chainsaw Man. I really enjoyed my time with Fure Punch but it was very confusing throughout a lot of it which def through me off.
7/4/2022 23:01:19	My first experience with his work was chainsaw man, it was so captivating and the characters where really good and dang i didnt expect some of them would die But i remember my first initial reaction was just "this is the coolest manga I've ever read" 
7/4/2022 23:06:13	It was csm. The concept of the story was a bit hard to understand and a little abstract, but once you get into it, it really shines. Lovely character writing and I especially liked makima’s writing, she is a very well written antagonist. The art is amazing too, not too detailed but not too complex; panels are generally really well crafted.
7/4/2022 23:08:47	Sayonara eri. It was really unique; I enjoyed it a lot. Made me feel things I don’t know how to explain; truly a masterpiece. After that I read csm and I wasn’t disappointed. Concepts are so abstract and well thought out yet confusing at the same time, I love his work ^_^
7/4/2022 23:11:30	The first thing I read from him was fire punch and what really stood out to me was how unique of a voice he had through his writing.
7/4/2022 23:15:07	I came across Tatsuki Fujimoto work through csm. It was weird at the same time funny,cool and amazing.It made me fall in love with his work and then I started reading all his other works and all of them are weird with some deep theme. 
7/4/2022 23:15:48	mine was chainsaw man. my first impressions of csm i really liked it i fucking loved it i didn’t know what i was getting into when i read i’m glad i did tatsuki fujimoto is the fucking goat csm brought me to a lot of emotions great ass manga. especially the snowball scene kinda made me sad
7/4/2022 23:19:32	Heard about CSM because of the anime, wanted to read it before it came out. I loved everything about it the arts great, characters are great, great story. Haven’t read anything else. Fire punch looks weirder and less “cool” but idk maybe I’ll read it one day.
7/4/2022 23:25:04	Weird, Amazing 
7/4/2022 23:28:04	CSM. I love this god damned manga so much, it might be one of the best pieces of media I've ever consumed. I found it funny, weird gory, amazing, every good word under the sun and moon. And then there's the amazing art style. But yeh I love this manga
7/4/2022 23:29:03	My first impressions of Tatsuki Fujimoto were in CSM which was an experience of mixed feelings but it was pretty good to say the least. then I went on to read fire punch which I was not expecting. it was a good manga but I have no clue how someone thinks of stuff like that which at time made me ill. Alas it was a decent manga but I prefer CSM. most of and if not all of Tatsuki Fujimoto works are great for anyone wanting to get into manga. He is a great artist and mangaka that has his career lined up for success ever since CSM blew up. I know that fire punch was still popular but I think CSM is what really blew him into mainstream especially ever since CSM got announced to be animated by MAPPA. -oblivvion
7/4/2022 23:31:51	The first work that i read from tatsuki fujimoto Sensei was good bye eri and my first impression was confusion but i also felt something that i can't really explain and i say it's great the fact that good bye eri is fucking movie is still insane to me it didn't feel boring at all  Then i read look back and my first impression was entertaining it was fun to read 
7/4/2022 23:34:24	The first manga I came across was Fire Punch, initially it was the art style that caught my attention but then I read it and really enjoyed the story, afterwards I went on too read some of his other works and that really cemented the appreciation I had towards his work , surely it's not all perfect and definitely not gonna fit everyone but Fujimoto sensei's storytelling accompanied but his art has led him to be one of my favorite maga authors.
7/4/2022 23:40:33	It was CSM. The manga's pretty cool.
7/4/2022 23:41:53	I first read CSM and loved it because of its fast pace and unpredictable outcomes and loved it. So I read more of fujimotos work. The more I read the more I thought he was a nut case, like he literally tried to levitate and roleplays as a 8 year old girl on twitter but he is still quite a talented author and CSM had become my favourite story's ever.
7/4/2022 23:56:22	Fire punch was my first read by him, and I finished it all in one sitting. I've never done that before. It was strange, bizarre, and captivating until the end. All of his stuff it pretty good, but his Fire Punch stuff and onwards (CSM, Look Back, Goodbye Eri) has this sort-of classic movie vibe to it. The type that something like 2001: A Space Odyssey has. It has their essence of you don't understand it but still enjoy it. It reminds me of that.
7/5/2022 0:09:45	Unique and something special than ordinary media , the first manga of him that I came across was Fire Punch. I thought it was pretty vile ,edgy and interesting.  He is a master of this art form 
7/5/2022 0:18:56	I really enjoyed his art style and the way he draws actions scenes. It was chainsaw man I read it all in one sitting and was blown away by the story, characters and almost everything about it. It was cool funny amazing and also dumb and weird but in a good way.
7/5/2022 0:27:26	It was fire punch. The subject matters were mostly depressing but that's why it felt real and when fujimoto tried to lay a message it hit harder than anything else. It was definitely weird but it had a certain vibe only few authors can accomplish (example haruki murakami) At first i thought it was just a normal edgy manga but it slowly became one of my favorites as the story unfolded
7/5/2022 0:41:01	Chainsaw man like most and gawd dammit it was love at first sight and as the manga kept going on I just fell more and more in love with it. I binge read everything up until chapter 87(it was still ongoing when I binges) and waited every week to see that next one, absolutely incredible Manga from start to finish #rezebestgirl and was my favorite Manga ever until last week where I found Gantz 
7/5/2022 0:41:38	I found him through chainsaw man and i liked most of it, i liked the chaotic feel of the story but at some points of the story it felt kinda stupid. Some scenes were honestly great and some others was just a strange way of storytelling. I read his one shot, goodbye eri, already guessing that it was going to be like chainsawman in its writing way but honestly I couldn’t have been more wrong.  Reading Goodbye eri was like watching a top tier movie, a movie about the last moments of someones life. It felt so real and true, i didnt think a person could write both of these, One was chaotic, messy but fun and overall fantastic but the other was just masterful storytelling at its peak, however both are still peak fiction.
7/5/2022 0:44:35	My first impressions of Fujimoto's work come from CSM, and whoa, the artwork is very simple than others (miura for example) yet can be very detailed. From the writing pov it's really good and hooks you very much to the story, I remember that I literally devoured CSM, i started to read it at 9/10 am and finished in one take at like 1/2 am of the next day. I also read his latest one shots and I just loved them, the topics he generally explores and the way he does are just fantastic. Now I'm just hyped af for CSM to come back in a week.
7/5/2022 0:46:26	CSM, and i like how he tell his stories is rly different and also the art style, he has no limit, he reminds me a character from Bakuman Eji Nizuma… 
7/5/2022 0:59:04	The first work I read from Fujimoto was Chainsaw-man and honestly I loved it. I found it cool, hilarious, fast and felt that it didn't waste a second of my time.
7/5/2022 1:22:00	Fire punch. I thought it was really cool and weird...but like in a good way.
7/5/2022 1:26:27	My first impression was hearing about one of Fujimoto's manga from a SuperEyepatchWolf video. It seemed genuine and eccentric. When I first read it, I felt the same way. That manga was Chainsaw Man. I thought it was hilarious, cool, and nothing like any other manga I read at that point.
7/5/2022 1:40:31	CSM then Fire Punch. I found the characters really interesting. Why have they done the things that they did and will do. I really like the characters in the stories. The characters are somehow have these extraordinary powers but their feeling feels so real and I emphasize with them. Not only are they relatable but they are also struggling.
7/5/2022 1:40:44	*(I'm fine with this being shared but this will be very long and will probably not be punctuated correctly and it'll mention other manga but it might be worth it to read and you will learn some stuff. It'll talk about Fujimoto but also my story, so please read this all, I've handled too much and I just want to be listened to for once)*  I love Tatsuki Fujimoto's work. It looks sorta like something you'd see out of a detailed sketch book except each sketch helps tell a story. I first heard about chainsawman was from watching ether a yellowflash video or an it'sAGundum video but one or both of them talked about how demon slayer and chainsaw man we're outselling the entire comic industry and I liked the title and idea of it and my friend even heard about it but he kinda thought it was something he wouldn't like. *(he had some form of dread in his eyes)* I definitely wanted to read it and at some point my friend was all of a sudden interested in it and he read it online and forgot about the time where he said about how chainsaw man seems weird and something he didn't want to read but then after he read it online he bought all 11 volumes at the end of the school year and I got to borrow the first 2 volumes before the end of the school year and It's now my favorite manga but I'm waiting for it to get a box set before I buy it. *(Which sadly might not possibly happen but it could)* all I know about chainsawman is the first 2 volumes and sorta the darkness devil fight and I also think something tragic happens to Aki and then he dies at some point but chainsaw man has become my favorite manga and has made some of my favorite characters such as Kobeni and Aki and it has inspired me with my work that I have thought up *(haven't exactly put it on paper though)* Right now I'm reading demon slayer which I got the box set of, and I'm where season 1 left of and that's all I know of the story *(Enmu is my favorite character in demon slayer and he's also my favorite character alongside the other 2 chainsaw man characters I mentioned earlier)* but of course I'm waiting to go back to school so I can re-read the first 2 volumes of chainsaw man plus the rest of it. But no matter what going back to school is going to be hell and that's kinda all life has ever been for me. An easy way to describe my life is that I'm not the main character and that I'm just some side character silhouette that you never hear or see the face of and at this point I've been crippled by all of it. I've got almost if not any friends, all the ones I call friends sort of silently betrayed me because I have to say someones name 80 to 200 times *(and counting)* to get their attention and then when I start talking someone else immediately grabs their attention and I'm stuck in silence. They don't text me or respond to my messages and even if I try and talk to them they ether don't listen or I talk to them and they don't even mention or acknowledge me again, last time I was talking to someone and doing something I was told to shut up *(and these are supposed to be good people)* but the friends I do have are almost sorta gone because some of them went to other schools and the ones I have left there's not much to do with. One doesn't have a phone except for a landline, the other one is the one I borrow manga from and he's an obnoxious, annoying, porn addict and when he makes a joke he uses the same lines like "my asshole burns" or I will "molest you" or "I will lomest you" and he means this as a joke but he just takes a toll on me and at one point he even admitted to watching child porn out of the blue and just straight out of nowhere and then after him is my best friend who's mind has deteriorated of the last few years he doesn't start and conversation with me because he doesn't know what to say and his response to anything good is "sex!" And to anything not good he replies "not sex!" And I had him try a single player game when I had him over and he couldn't keep it going and i couldn't find a way to start one or even just joke because it always ends up in silence. People never talk to me and they never and no one really asks how I'm doing ether so all I can do is listen to everyone's conversations in a room, read manga, or just sit there staring in the same place talking inside my head for hours until class is over and all I do is stay silent but I think this is what created my story creating ability because I can think of a scene and then create a storyline off of it. It's great but I have no one to share it with except my best friend and I don't even get to tell my relatives and the books I've bought because they don't ask me how I'm doing really ether. Of course one of them briefly said that manga was the gayest thing ever when I said I bought some *(my cousin is an asshole but he thinks but he thinks he's being nice and of course he's screwing that up and will never realize it)* but at our last family gathering everyone was talking to each other and I was there but I was never asked anything and if I talked to someone the conversation didn't last long and then I walked back and forth by the table they were sitting at outside in the backyard and I walked back and forth in a line just sorta pacing around and their conversations were things like who's more autistic and which of the cousins looks like they'd be adopted, they didn't say me for the adopted one but when I tried to add something no one heard me and then later when we were standing in a circle talking then I tried to add something and I got interrupted each time *(even when I said the whole sentence no one bothered to stop and hear)* and then my family also makes fun of me from time to time *(a lot)* and when I make fun of them and their not in the mood for it they tell me to stop and I stop but if they make fun of me and I ask to stop... Then they just continue. My suffering has lead to some good story ideas to pull from my life and make a manga out of and other mangas are ideas that I've just randomly thought of. I've maybe come up with 20 to 30 story ideas already and they're each great in their own respective way but I don't really have the energy to design the characters and scenes I perfectly picture in my head and I'm not someone who's even motivated at their lowest so I have no sense of motivation and I might never will. My dad tried to motivate me to do my work with getting me anything no matter what it cost and I was going to get a PC but I wasn't motivated enough because each night I tried to get myself to do it and I couldn't instead I'd listen to music and just look at my homework and that's what I had been doing for the entire year when that happens but I was doing that for the entire 2nd semester and then my family made jokes about me repeating the same grade again *(good thing I'm not)* and another problem is that I want to develop my own video games and write and draw manga when I'm older but that seems like it'll be a time crunch. No one has heard my since I can remember and the first time I noticed it was in 3rd or 4th grade and now I'm going into 10th and it's only gotten worse. I was told by my mom that some things get worse before they get better but for me I ether will have some big ass pay off in life or ether I'll be stuck in the same trench and I'll have to just watch it as it buries me deeper. When I read chainsaw man I read something that I related to and that was when Denji talked to pochita about what he thinks a perfect date for him would be or how he wondered what it was like to hold a girl. *(I think he mentioned that)* and when I create something I'm not great with creating names because it takes me a bit to come up with them *(also I try to make ones that doesn't sound like your typical name)* and I can barely think of a code name for myself but I've thought of 2, one being "silhouette" and that relates to how I'm just a background character in everything I do and the other name is "the one true ruler" and that's because of one of my manga ideas but with the amount of stories I have in my mind I'm worried that I'll never be able to tell any of them and that they'll be lost to time and even if I leave unfinished ones behind I'm afraid they won't be done justice. But to gain more story telling power I'm going to have to read more manga which I barely have any except for the demon slayer box set, all of JoJo part 1, and the first perfect edition for 20th century boys and a volume of JoJo part 4.  I have a whole lot to say because I've been silenced for too long and have been betrayed by many and I'll probably remember something I forgot to say and I'll regret not mentioning it in here but I do have some manga and show recommendations along with a few more things. First of all I'm probably going to get fire punch. And second of all I recommend the manga "Usogui" it's a crazy hidden gem of a gambling manga *(so it hasn't been translated)* but it takes some basic gambling manga things to the absolute extreme and a lot of scenarios are worse than death. I haven't read it but it's a complete manga and it's supposed to be very good. As for a show recommendation I'd have to recommend "CHUCK" and "Burn Notice" because those are some shows that are complete and have a consistent amount of quality that gets better*(also maybe watch "whitecollar" and "Leverage" too and maybe "Father Ted" along with "Sledge hammer")*  If you want to hear my story ideas and the other recommendations I have then please try to reach out to my somehow because I'd like to discuss it with someone that doesn't contribute to me feeling like I'm only a shell of a person and that actually wants to speak. *(Also I liked you profile picture when it was Aki but the new one also suits you well)* but I hope we can speak with each other through discord or something because I'm tired of sitting calmly in the fire of my own hell and I actually want to speak with someone who isn't a mindless husk and I don't know how we'd speak to each other but my life really doesn't seem like it'll get much better but I hope if you at least read all this then you'll maybe, hopefully turn the stream into a YouTube video *(if I have to reach out in the comments then that'll be tough but hopefully we can speak with each other)* If things don't work out for reaching out then hopefully we'll find each other someday do I'll at least have someone to talk to and talk about chainsawman and other manga with. Please I have a story to tell.l, So at least try to talk to me if you can  I hope my stories and cries for help reach you and everyone else. Stay blessed
7/5/2022 1:53:52	CSM: fresh ideas, interesting and engaging, more focused on the action than the plot tbh. didn't expect the story to be that deep, only had the gun devil in mind as the main villain. always kinda felt that makima was some kind of villain, also lowkey spoiled from some youtube videos so i guess that was why the reveal wasn't as impactful in my own experience.
7/5/2022 1:56:44	Came across CSM, and i think its very weird in a goofy way! I like the series so much because i can relate to some of the characters. I love tatsuki fujimotos mangas mostly because he doesnt follow the usual shounen template? (power of friendship, etc). and i like that the MC just has shallow dreams, not something grand like conquering the world or something. its refreshing!
7/5/2022 1:59:19	csm. it was peak
7/5/2022 2:12:50	Lit Punch
7/5/2022 2:27:07	Fire Punch was my entry into the world of Tatsuki Fujimoto. I was really immersed into his Worldbuilding and sheer absurdity of it. Looking back tho it could have been my horny teenage brain justifying my new interest in Incest. Ill reread it when i get the chance.  Anyway... hope you have a wonderfull day Alex <3 Thx for being awesome :3  Also! Read Grand Blue if u havent! 
7/5/2022 2:37:07	My first impressions were from Chainsaw Man, due to the amount of hype it was receiving in 2020. Throughout my first read, my only thought was “how the fuck is this in shonen jump”? But I also found it quite interesting. In my opinion, Chainsaw Man surprised me, as it is one of the most unpredictable shonen manga I’ve ever read. Many other series will follow the same cliché pattern shit and after a while, it gets boring. I would, without a doubt, put Chainsaw Man as one of favorites of the newer generation.
7/5/2022 2:45:01	Tatsuki Fujimoto became my favourite mangaka after reading the "Goodbye, Eri" one-shot. The first thing that I've read from him was "Fire Punch" which I thought was very refreshing, then I came across Chainsaw Man and I thought that this would be his magnum opus because I loved everything about it, it was super weird and amazing. But the story that made me cry is the story about movies. As well as Fujimoto I am a huge movie freak and there is not many mangas about making movies so I read it without second thoughts, and I thought it was brilliant. The panelling which makes me feel like watching a movie, the characters, the payoff. I was blown away and I hope that Fujimoto will only grow to deliver more amazing stories like that one... and more Chainsaw Man too, that shit was too good
7/5/2022 3:08:09	My first was CSM and i was just amazed by the story and characters
7/5/2022 3:11:53	weird
7/5/2022 3:26:13	I thought that the manga would be normal. I first read CSM. I thought it was amazing. It has everything a manga needs. The Comedy, the action, and the great side characters. Overall his stories are really great. 
7/5/2022 3:43:16	I started CSM but only read a couple chapters, then later on read all of Fire Punch as my first proper introduction to his work. Fire Punch was incredibly impressive artistically and was an incredibly cool story then it hit the midway point and it become so bizarre that it has become one of the most conflicting/divisive stories I have ever read. It was good and I enjoyed it, but also confused the fuck out of me. A tad bit later I read CSM all the way through and realized that a good portion of that was just the Fujimoto way, but the other portion is just Fire Punch. This intrinsic strangeness makes Fire Punch arguably the more interesting read for an entrance to Fujimoto works, but CSM is definitely the better overall.
7/5/2022 3:55:35	Chainsaw man. It was very different than the other manga I had read(including other shounen One Piece, Kaiju no 8 etc). It had the most stupid fucking humor but was quite funny, and it felt like whenever it got real it just got covered up by Denji. I liked the art style as well it’s quite different from other manga in the same vein AOT, Hells paradise. It is much more gory and doesn’t hold back in the art. Oh it was dumb very dumb.
7/5/2022 4:04:11	It was definitely CSM and it was crazy! Amazing art and plot twists I haven't seen before. Only Berserk can beat this shit in terms of beauty
7/5/2022 4:09:29	First was csm . It was a awesome manga I liked it's story ,denji was cool and awesome in his final fight that fight was above my expectation and the panels in that fight was superb . The chapters which had gun devil are my favorite chapters of csm manga . At start some parts in the manga was wired but those parts gave a different vibe to the manga and it made the reading experience unique and it made the manga extra enjoyable. I have also read fire punch and to me it's equal to csm. Tatsuki Fujimoto's art style during the fight scenes. Last check out "Rainbow" manga it's awesome and u will like it.
7/5/2022 4:20:28	First manga was CSM and it was amazing 
7/5/2022 4:32:03	One shot ... It was amazing he's truly genius 
7/5/2022 4:51:09	I came across Chainsaw Man when it was still in its early chapters and read it up until Reze was introduced. It was probably because of the hype of the bomb girl arc, but I was immediately hooked in by how different it was from the other manga that was running in jump. The premise was solid and the characters were handled so beautifully. The absurdity of the tone is what makes it so great, and it comes off as sincere enough to just make you accept whatever the hell is happening. Even if you weren't aware of it, you can just feel that Fujimoto wanted to tell a good story, he doesn't meander to appeal to the readers.  His style resonated with me and I owe it to him for my current taste in manga and media in general. Reading his other works made me realize that he's a true visionary, he's like the Kanye of manga and is making waves throughout the industry. He'll undoubtedly make more masterpieces and I won't be surprised if he decides to work on film in the future. 
7/5/2022 4:57:12	I read Fire Punch, before CSM. I like Fire punch a little more, the twisted, devasted world they live in is amazing. Agni has such an amazing journey, starting as a child feeding the village with his body. Becoming a God serving his people with his body. I find his art work to be so fire 😉. Full page battle panels looked so damn good!
7/5/2022 5:05:26	Fire Punch was weird and fun to read, but i had some trouble following the story as it came out weekly
7/5/2022 5:08:20	I first came across Fire Punch, but I read from start to finish CSM. I though he had some extremely cool concepts, and that his works were really good. I think his art is incredible, and his writing goes hand in hand with it. Though I think he has some weirdness to him, which I think helps him write some characters to be more relatable or lovable.   Love your videos, keep up the good work! 
7/5/2022 5:14:48	I haven't read much manga so by that standard i will keep it at weird and cool 
7/5/2022 5:16:39	"what the fuck" It was CSM. I loved every second of it. It was cool in a weird way, it felt like he really knew how to thread the line between humor and an unholy amount of gore
7/5/2022 5:42:27	Read CSM thought it was balllllinnnn. Im a big fan of those fucked up kind of mind fuck stories. Next I read Fire Punch and it was pretty good (loved how fucking unique it was). Not a fan of the dog fucking scene tho LOL
7/5/2022 6:01:15	it was chainsawman and the first thing i noticed was that the art was simple but unique. Usually i don't like simple art but fujimoto's art somehow feels very "full" 
7/5/2022 6:22:43	Well I came across csm while shopping  for some manga since I was pretty new into reading manga I was gonna buy the vol 1 hardcover of jjba battle tendency I saw vol 1 csm I knew I had to get it since it was always sold out so I ordered both and when they arrived I read csm first since it was shorter and omg I could not have prepared  myself on how wacky crazy and overall crazy csm was I was Instantly  hooked and bought the other volumes over time I LOVED IT, one way I could describe csm to newcomers is that it's all style all substance and somehow gritty and dark at the same time, 10/10 fujimoto is a genius, can't wait for the adaptation (sorry for making this a whole review)
7/5/2022 6:30:05	it was truly unique, i started with chainsaw man and it was so weird yet so appealing. while i waited for the new chps to be released i read fire punch all in one go and i loved it. Then fujimoto is making these one shots and OMG im in love with his gory yet philosophical writing.
7/5/2022 6:35:11	My first Fujimoto manga was Fire Punch, and it was interesting at first with the differing art style and themes at the time. Near the end of the manga, I got confused and lost interest with the direction it went, but I'm pretty sure it's cause I didn't understand it. I think CSM is a bit over-rated in comparison to the one shots such as "Look Back" and "Goodbye, Eri", which I thoroughly enjoyed.
7/5/2022 6:36:21	(Chainsawman) The manga was cool and fresh loved the bleak world and interesting MC I had a great time reading it.
7/5/2022 6:42:23	It was fire punch back around 2019 to 2020, i thought the ideas were relatively simple but it was executed really well, the same can be said about chainsawman. They were really funny, a few of his ideas were really interesting, and his style of writing was unique, you could tell you're reading a Tatsuki Fujimoto's manga with just a page or two(ignoring the art).  I love his art, the gritty, sketchy artstyle fits all his stories perfectly. Even though i was disappointed with the ending of fire punch, the contents and the story it told was really powerful for me, so I have no problems reading anything he made.   I was a fan since the first few chapters of fire punch I read.
7/5/2022 6:43:06	First impressions of chainsaw man was it was different. It has a solid start from which I had no idea what I was getting into
7/5/2022 6:47:16	I read the first chapter of chainsaw man and i can’t be arsed to read the rest
7/5/2022 6:55:33	I started with CM. My first impression was how strangely human those weird characters were, from chapter 1 of CM you already have Denji that you can "relate". I thought it was cool, dumb and weird, but I loved those first chapters. 
7/5/2022 7:02:21	CSM. I loved every single panel of it and it is one of my favorite manga of all time. I’ve yet to read Fire Punch, but I read every one-shot he released and loved most of them, especially Goodbye Eri which is a meta tour-de-force in emotional storytelling.
7/5/2022 7:03:28	Back then I wasn't into mangas that much , then I came across Fire Punch . Firstly I thought that I was some sort of superhero manga, taking revenge, giving justice etc. But when I read the first chapter I was like wth I just read. Chapters after chapters it became more and more interesting ( and fucked up too ). I loved it, it had everything just everything dumb, wierd, funny etc, etc. First I thought this writer is somewhat psycho ( it was when I didn't started reading yandere stuffs ) but as the story continued I understood everything. It was hella deep af. Tatsuki Fujimoto kept me hooked up with mangas more and more  ; )
7/5/2022 7:05:33	It was CSM. I thought the name sounded a bit dumb but i was quickly disproven. i believe that reading chainsaw man was one of the best experiences I've had reading anything.   The art was amazing and had a very unique style to it. It also had a great balance of goofy and serious moments. It was an amazing first impression of Tatsuki Fujimoto's work.
7/5/2022 7:06:05	I haven't actually read his works, just wanted to say hi, though I have been waiting for the CSM anime, will be disappointed if it does not bust my nut
7/5/2022 7:54:29	I have read Fire Punch, Chainsaw Man, and two one shots. While they do not really resonate with me emotionally that much, they are highly entertaining. I do not know what will heppen when he creates something. My favorite characters of his are unhinged and compelling, and that is all I need. He as an author screws with his audience and I love that.
7/5/2022 7:57:46	It's really chaotic, yet really enjoyable and fun
7/5/2022 8:27:23	I read chainsaw man about a year and a half ago and it was one of the first mangas that i read. At first i thought it was interesting and i loved the artwork and even now, after reading a considerable amount of mangas, i still think the same things; it's not the best and original thing that i ever read when it comes to storytelling and other factors but it was still a good and fun experience that i will certainly remember.
7/5/2022 8:50:41	First Impression: "What the fuck did I just read?" CSM What did you think of it - I NEED more Just.... Outstanding, all of it. Plot armour? What's that? Just, it was fucking crazy like huh what how
7/5/2022 9:02:04	My first work of his was CSM. At the start I just thought "who the hell thinks of this, it's so strange" then I got to the 'failed make-out" panel while I was eating Chili... mf'er. But since finishing CSM I've gone on and read all this crazy dudes stuff and I love it. 
7/5/2022 9:13:24	The first work I read by Fujimoto was Chainsaw Man; I think it was amazing. The controlled chaos on top of the more sad and bittersweet moments made it not only an extremely fun manga to read, but it also created a unique flurry of emotions im yet to come across in any other manga, at least to the same degree that Chainsaw Man does it. Fujimoto's writing is beautiful in such a unique, personal way and im glad I discovered him, and I hope more people do.
7/5/2022 9:14:54	I remember finding chainsaw man and reading it on the way to school back when it had like 30 chapters. I greeted my friends then just kept reading cause i was engrosed in the story. The art was rough but appealing and the characters seemed different in the best way possible. It became one of my favourites instantaniously.
7/5/2022 9:24:58	I first read Chainsaw Man, heard of it due to the anime hype. Initially I found it to be boring… however after a while I grew really fond of it. Why is something I wish I could pinpoint better, but I’m sure it has to do with the characters atleast. I’ve read CSM, Fire Punch, A Look Back and Goodbye Eri, 3 of which I found to be very good, and I feel all of them have a unique feel to their characters.  In CSM i enjoyed viewing Denji question his goals. He wanted to touch tits, tits were thrash, well what the fuck now? Is life just an endless cycle of eventual dissappointment? Interesting questions.  Same with Agni in Fire Punch. I love the scene where Agni is in the basement with all the prisoners. Here he questions his motivation. He was here to film a movie, why is he doing this? Why shouldn’t he rescue the prisoners? In the end it appears he would rather rescue the prisoners than get help from moviegirl, which I find to be a rather beautiful reflection on his own morals and motivation.  Goodbye Eri is just a confusing mess that was very good :)  A Look Back kinda garbo doe innit? I’m sure there is a message I’m missing, but I can’t ignore the boredom it made me feel.
7/5/2022 9:30:31	My first experience was Chainsaw Man. At first I thought the art was lacking and the story and protagonist was childish (Denji’s fascination with bewbs). And then I read the next few volumes, clocked onto what Fujimoto was doing and realised the man may ACTUALLY be a genius. 
7/5/2022 9:42:58	CSM, in one word the best way I could describe it: chaotic. But in a good way, the way fights are structured as a gore fest or a giant man made of chainsaws going on a date with a fast food employee the thing was chaotic from start to finish and it was great.
7/5/2022 10:01:03	CSM. I though it was cool even though I have not finished it yet. I am a female who normally isn't into many shonen minus shonen romances. But Chainsaw Man is very interesting, and I wanna see more things from SJ now thanks to it. 
7/5/2022 10:05:40	fire punch, kinda weird but i like it
7/5/2022 10:38:29	When I first read CSM I immediately knew that this was a funny manga by a funny man with a unique way of doing things
7/5/2022 10:52:36	My first manga by tatsuki fujuimoto was fire punch and it had a really good idea I really enjoyed it but it kinda got worse. In the beginning it was a 9/10 for me but at the end of volume five it was a really low 8/10.
7/5/2022 11:29:45	Chainsaw man: I fucking loved it!! It was so cool to read a manga with such an unhinged protagonist!  It also sparked my love of characters with spiky teeth so there’s that too! 
7/5/2022 11:45:37	I've read sayonara eri, and i read the first 30ish chapters of fire punch back when CSM started. I absolutely loved his artstyle and i love the way he portrays characters, as they seem somewhat disconnected from the common sense you would expect from a real person, which makes sense considering they're put in situations common sense doesn't apply to. His depiction of backgrounds and the pages of panels with no speech bubbles builds tension(i personally don't like it as I'm a dialogue guy). His works are deep and leave you pondering about the way his characters think, which i appreciate since i don't like reading action manga, which is the only reason i haven't read chainsawman yet actually. Im hyped for the anime to come out in october though
7/5/2022 11:52:10	Read Fire Punch first. Shit was whack in the best possible way. I feel like a lot of it went over my head especially closer to the end
7/5/2022 11:53:58	First read Fire Punch as recommended by a friend. His writing is very bizarre and his art style very unique, I found it surprising that it was a shonen jump manga. I have read many manga but Fujimoto's work stands alone, twisting and manipulating the essence of typical shonen to create something completely different. I believe that as the previous kings of shonen (Demon Slayer, Jujetsu Kaisen, and Black Clover) either ended or are coming to an end, Fujimoto's work will have set the new standard for Shonen Jump, and we will see a new golden age.
7/5/2022 12:34:46	The first Fujimoto manga I came across was CSM, and I gotta tell you… my first impressions were “Holy crap the art is amazing, holy crap the characters are awesome, and holy crap the story is hella cool.” (more or less idk). Also it was pretty weird but really awesome 🙏
7/5/2022 12:47:26	I encountered chainsaw man because of the crazy hype surrounding it. I gotta be honest the chainsaw man manga was S tier, I definitely want THAT SCENE 😏 adapted in the anime, I know it will be adapted after knowing about the answers MAPPA CEO and staff gave in anime expo!! I'm excited!!!!😍
7/5/2022 12:49:03	The first Manga I had heard of was Fire Punch but because the name was fucking retarded, I never looked into it. Then I here something called “Chainsaw Man” and I think “This names even stupider? Let’s read it.” So I read through all of CSM in like a day and then proceeded to have an organism over how good it was. It was an amazing and confusing experience. A lot of the story I didn’t get until I looked back on it and realized just how weird the whole premise is. Main Character’s dog looks like an ass with a chainsaw sticking out of it, then he dies to a deformed fetus monster, and I’m squirting all over my bed looking at Makima. I would keep going on my reactions and emotions I felt while reading but In general, I love this manga to my core and it being one of the few mangas I’ve read makes me want to read more. 
7/5/2022 13:45:41	Makima is a baddie
7/5/2022 13:47:19	First manga i read by Tatsuki Fujimoto was CSM, at first i thought it was wierd and absurd but it looked like a really fun read. So i gave the manga a shot and read the entire thing in one session, could not stop myself from reading it. Great work, at least a 9/10 for me.
7/5/2022 14:41:43	One-shot. It was okay.
7/5/2022 15:14:08	CSM- on the first read I thought it was mostly just confusing and found it hard to string along what was happening as it was just so different from anything I had read before. Eventually when I caught up with the chapters releasing I left it only to come back to the finished manga which I re-read. This time i took my time when reading it so things were easier to understand! Which was great as it thought it was so unique and made me laugh a ton :0 
7/5/2022 15:26:53	i've heard about him through a friend that read CSM but my first work of his was the one shot Yogen no Nayuta,and i really enjoyed his art style and "vibe" but it only really clicked after reading Goodbye eri(which is probably my favorite one shot,if not one of my favorite mangas of all time) i really enjoyed how you could not tell if the actions were real or a movie,after that i've read fire punch and a bunch of his one shots,i like the crazy but kinda interpersonal narrative he makes with Agni. And his recent one shot wich I interpreted as him saying people read to much in to his work(like i'm doing it right now) and maybe how scared he is to disappoint with CSM 2. Found your channel thru the Ayashimon video and really enjoyed your writing and editing,I was surprised to see that you were a 30k channel.  Sorry if it's a little confusing english is not my first language. Cheers from Brazil
7/5/2022 15:38:30	I picked up a few volumes of chainsaw man randomly over a year ago and didn't ever read them until a few months ago. I can't even remember why I bought them and I wasn't too aware of its popularity yet. But once I did start reading it I was obsessed and blew through the whole thing in about a week. I heard someone describe the story as "A dog learning to become a human," and I feel like that's the best way to describe it. It's hard to say exactly why I like it so much, but ever since I read it I've become obsessed with reading comics and manga again for the first time in like 4 years. Also Tatsuki Fujimoto is absolutely goated. I've enjoyed everything I've read of his so far and can't wait for whatever comes next.
7/5/2022 16:29:23	I read csm and fire punch I was cool and kinda dumb Sorry
7/5/2022 16:31:55	First work i came across was Chainsaw Man, the specific panel that caught my eye was Aki standing with a handkerchief with slayed zombies laying around. I thought man this looks gruesome but also clean at the same time. After reading through it i got immersed in Fujimotos works, the part that always sticks with me is that it feels fairly "cinematic", great characters, pure chaos mixed with emotional weight of the same characters throughout the story. The art seems rough at times but it honestly works well in Fujimotos style of storytelling.
7/5/2022 16:32:45	I actually came across CSM first because the my friends kept hyping the fk out of it. The art is really good but i kinda slept on the story. Maybe it is just too complex for my smooth brain or the fact just super weird that threw me off quite a bit. Also read Summer Time Render Eheheheheheheh got to be my fav mango 
7/5/2022 16:33:54	I first read CSM, and my first impression was that he was an author that is not afraid to tell what he wants. I have since read fire-punch and you can see how he grew from fire-punch to csm. Yesterday, I read the newest oneshot. And thought that he basically said that maybe people were looking much into his work. And is probably afraid of how well received csm part 2 will be received. But I can say everything he does is amazing!
7/5/2022 16:33:58	BLAME! greatest piece of literature I have ever read 
7/5/2022 16:38:36	Read CSM first, kinda skimmed through it quickly just cause how good it was. the artstyle was superb and it i instantly got attached to it. 
7/5/2022 16:42:26	The first manga of his I read was Chainsaw Man and I loved it.I especially loved the 'rough' art style and overall tone. After reading more of his stuff I think my I think my favourite of his works might be Goodbye Eri. 
7/5/2022 16:49:41	CSM was the first work of his that I came across. It was the first time I've read anything as silly and dumb yet at the same time the coolest shit ever. It's become my favourite genre, whatever it is. Ever since then I've been in love with Fujimoto's works. My favourite of his is Goodbye Eri! 
7/5/2022 17:15:24	It was August 2020, back when new chapters for Chainsawman released weekly. I came across that one image where Denji is holding a chainsaw which is covering half of his face. The chainsaw also has a reflection of Makima on it. It got me intetested so I looked it up through image search and boom. Chainsawman. I immediately started reading it. I remember while reading the first chapter I was like "HOLY FUCK A CHAINSAW CAME OUT OF HIS HEAD". I caught up on the manga pretty quickly since most of Fujimoto's works are fast-paced. And then I read it weekly for around 20 weeks. The overall experience was amazing. The artwork, the characters, the story-telling, the expression of emotions... Everything was top-notch. And then after CSM ended it's serialization I recommended it to my cousin. He got hooked and finished the whole manga in a day.
7/5/2022 17:23:01	short version: Fire Punch, weird but wildly intriguing with stellar artstyle and paneling, it was cool and weird at some times but made it that much more fun, not for everyone, 8 out of 10 imo.  If you have time to read this version: I have currently only read Fire Punch since I am waiting for the chainsawman anime before I dive into the manga, I saw some talks about fujimotos work and fire punch intrigued me with its inicial concept of a boy with regenerative powers with an everlasting flame engulfing his body, his mission for revenge was just the cherry on top to get me hooked, I read it and it threw me for a loop on many accounts, when I thought the story was going one way it somehow presented an element that had subtle undertones but now was full on display, its difficult to talk about fire punch and NOT talk about the glaring incestuous elements that are shown, cause it is there, personally I know its a story so I can care less as long as it is relevent in the plot which it was and got me invested as to find out what would happen next but I also understand why that can alienate many into not giving it a chance or hell even a passing glance which is a shame because fire punch is a story worthy of telling, its pretty short compared to other mangas and in general it has a defined artstyle that will get you at least a bit interested in what it has to say, I felt that the finale was a bit lackluster but maybe that was the whole point, the simbolism and philosophies are packed but I mean PACKED into the story be it the flame being constant and how it can represent someones inner struggles just taken literally, or how there are no real heroes just different points of view, to not drag out anymore of your time and wrap this up im completely greatful if you have gotten this far, fire punch is an interesting read for sure and is endearing in its own way, just recently I bought the first physical issue and it was strange to reread it once again, its like bumping into that weird kid in class that was never mean just that they were never good at first impressions but if you give them the chance they can say some really deep and inciteful stuff with some quirky strangeness inbetween each couple of phrases, thats how I see Fire Punch. 8 out of 10 would read again
7/5/2022 17:39:31	I’ve only read his one shots; but his story telling style is really unique!
7/5/2022 18:05:40	CSM
7/5/2022 18:19:38	The first manga I saw was Chainsaw Man, though it was only one chapter, so my first impression coming across a manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto was seeing how violent his series is. I read a bunch of his other one shots and 11 chapters of Fire Punch to get a better idea of what his stuff is like. Overall I think he is pretty great when it comes to writing out character motivations. Their thoughts and beliefs make me feel like I'm reading a story with real characters. Here are my stats of what I read and how I feel about them:  Chainsaw Man: 8/10 so far, I love Denji and his companion not a fan of the girl   Love is Blind: 3/10, The chapter was too ridiculous and I couldn't even enjoy it in a comedy perspective, it felt dumb for the sake of being dumb  Sasaki-kun Has Stopped A Bullet: 5/10, it's alright, I wasn't a fan of the weird God complex the MC gave the teacher and telling the shooter he was from the future, I did like the MC's motivation at what he wants to be when he's older that really wholesome  Goodbye, Eri: 8/10, I really liked the beginning and the emotions the MC felt when he recorded his mother and ran away from the building. Eri herself was a great character to help out the MC, their interactions felt organic and I can feel the passion she felt when describing why she loved his movie. The panels drawn were really clever, I've never seen anything like it. I was kinda put off at the end in all honesty, it felt shoehorned in which is why I didn't give it a higher score then it probably deserves  Look Back: 9/10, I love this one shot so much, it's my favorite. Firstly the beginning where the MC felt discouraged at her own art hit way too close to home. I had a friend who was better at art than I was and I envied her, I practiced so much right after trying to get better so I would get praised for having amazing art. The two have a great connection and seeing them draw together made me so happy. I understood the anger the MC had towards her friend when she wanted to go study at an art school. The bit that confused me was the scene where the girl was saved by someone who is like the MC. Besides that I love the heart this had and I shed a tear while reading this.  Fire Punch: 7/10 so far, I had to push myself to continue reading this because of the incest scene, the plot was interesting until San was introduced, I really like him and the young girl he met. (San reminds me of Butters from South Park) I kinda wished the story was about those two but it'll probably get better since I'm still at the very beginning so I can't wait to see what else this series has installed for me
7/5/2022 18:40:29	I first discovered Fujimoto through the surge of popularity in Chainsaw Man. When my local store was first promoting the release of the first volume I didnt think much of it. The cover looked ridiculous so i kinda just ignored it. As time went by I noticed a lot of youtube videos about it and more and more screenshots of the manga started surfacing. It didnt look like the work of a pro artist to me, but curiousity got the better of me. So I decided to buy volume 1. I finished it. Then I bought volume 2. I finished it. Then i bought volume 3. I have no idea why, but i found myself hooked. The way the story didnt shy away from trying to gross me out at times just felt like something I wanted out of a dark fantasy like CSM. In the end I even bought the entirety of Fire Punch after getting volume 4 of CSM and finding FP as a recommendation on the last few pages. Tatsuki Fujimoto isn't afraid to use more disturbing or gross concepts to dive into the nature of a world filled with death and I guess this is what made CSM and FP so endearing to me. Not to mention how his longer oneshots feel like he's speaking his mind directly to me, as if vaguely explaining his mind to me through his art. This is in my opinion the main appeal of Fujimoto's work. An author who shows how his characters feel and how he felt putting them through this.
7/5/2022 18:49:34	yes
7/5/2022 19:02:20	It was ok 
7/5/2022 19:13:33	I started off csm and it was cool and dumb at the same time
7/5/2022 19:29:24	ass dawgshit write better stories
7/5/2022 19:50:05	The first manga I read from him was Fire Punch. It was a weird experience reading it. It was beautiful and mesmerizing. But almost every manga I've read from Tatsuki Fujimoto, it always feels like we're watching a world way bigger than we are ever going to learn from this manga. The world building is my favourite part of his works. It always feels like there is so much stuff happening in that world, and we're just having a peek into the life of a small speck in a vast unknown world.
7/5/2022 20:02:13	My first impressions of Chainsaw Man, my first I believe, were simple, "The fuck am I looking at? I want more." I then continued to fail two classes in the pursuit of more CSM
7/5/2022 21:05:39	First and only work of his I have read is chainsaw man.  It was pretty good to very good(~8.5) throughout but then by the end my overall feelings were downgraded to an alright to good range (~7.5).   After typing all of that I've realized thats not first impressions. I'd say the first few chapters defintely had my attention and were intruiging (9/10). I'm not usually much of a shonen reader either.  
7/5/2022 21:31:21	Chainsaw man. I liked all the characters and so when they started dying off... I felt that. Comedy was also great! Goodbye Eri is probably my favorite one shot ever.
7/5/2022 22:06:33	One of my friends recommended csm to me when i had not really read any manga other than to finish a series that an anime didn't finish. I got more out of it than any anime I had watched, the memories of imagining the story through filling in the gaps created by manga especially in fights left me feeling more fulfilled after reading and enveloped in the story than any anime had. Maybe it being csm didn't matter but it was the tip of the iceberg that made me love reading manga so much more now. Also it killed anime for me cause it feels so slow compared to the pace you set when reading being in most cases much faster yet still easy to digest, again thats just a manga thing that it opened mt eyes to. Also art, I like art made around the idea of the manga in the authors head instead of the style an animation studio tends to make the shows they animate follow, this really opened my eyes to this because of just how beautiful pages can be. I think the contrast between panel sizes showing things that require so much more detail is just such a crazy awesome aspect of manga that nothing else captures. This ended up being just why I love manga but these are all things that fujimotos art through csm enlightened me to.
7/5/2022 23:36:56	First work I saw of his was chainsaw man, two years ago. I thought it was the weirdest shit ever- I loved it.  I really do love the art… I love the characters and how the plot progresses
7/5/2022 23:43:43	Boring and intriguing while reading fire punch after I finished I end up with a big incognita of what was that ending, but after reading CSM, I realized that just the style of Fujimoto; a combination of what seems to be a slow pace manga with some crazy twist that imitates the life itself and their surprises with such imaginative and unreal scenarios  
7/6/2022 0:01:01	Fire Punch was the first work I had experienced of Tatsuki Fujimoto. Shit was wacky fucking crazy, read it few years ago already so memory of it is pretty hazy but it was a ride for sure, just leaving me confused by the end, but an enjoyable reading experience overall with how wacky shit got. Shit was kinda fire I guess?? Haha get it, fire, fire punch.
7/6/2022 0:22:24	I found chainsaw man first and immediately thought it was... Interesting to say the least. A great introduction to Fujimoto's writing style and humor is denji's entire motivation being wanting to touch boobs, plus the puke scene literally stunlocked me for like 2 minutes 
7/6/2022 0:36:50	After the first chapter of Firepunch, I was half-convinced this man was either insane or a genius. Turns out it was the latter.
7/6/2022 0:49:29	I read a lot of manga in my youth but had a slump the last 10 years or so. Started getting back into it the last few months and one of the manga I saw recommended basically everywhere was CSM. Bought the first three volumes and really liked them. The art is quite cool and the designs as well as lore of the different devils are pretty interesting. After that, I got the rest of the available volumes bit by bit but got more and more lukewarm on the series as it went along. Found some of the later devils (especially the doll devil) a bit confusing and the end felt really anticlimactic to me. So overall I would say it was fine.
7/6/2022 1:23:45	Looks entertaining it was chain saw man and I have never read anything better 
7/6/2022 1:32:59	i came across CSM through online friends recommending it during its serialisation, i’d never read anything like it the pacing was break neck, yet it still managed to have heart + deeply emotional moments thanks to his expert panelling. i’ll never forget reading the darkness devil and gun devil spread, very few moments have come close in anime and manga for me every arc felt like a constant escalation and improvement and i ended up reading it all in a day.
7/6/2022 2:35:30	Chainsaw Man was my first experience and I started reading and I didn’t finish til I read all 97 chapters. It’s beautiful but not for everyone but I want everyone to experience it. Re read made it so much better too. 10/10 I’m A crack addict
7/6/2022 2:36:12	I've read both CSM, fire punch and a recent one shot and really liked them. that aside they are weird, and disgusting, i always end up sick after reading one. i believe most of his manga's influence comes from his MCs who can't be described as traditional in any sense. They are disgusting people with subpar, uninspiring motives but are still people you can relate to, for one thing his characters sure as hell ain't heroes, they're just broken people in hard situations trying to use the best of what they have to accomplish they're dreams whether its to eat jam on toast or marry your sister. Fujimoto has also made the habit of making his characters more 3 dimensional, heck i was shocked when i found out that girl on the picture above was trans and the way they introduced it shook me even more but it became more and more wholesome especially with Agni accepting her/him as who she is and even calling them big brother. the same goes for powers relationship with her team especially Denji who although I'm not sure it's a romantic one she certainly cares about him and makes him promise they'll also be friends in her next life. i like the lack of one sidedness to his characters. not to forget the topics he talks about bra, the theme's education, loss, debt, religion, cannibalism, simps get no bitches and human philosophy. bro only a genius can pack all that into one psychedelic trip. lastly i think the reason his works are so notorious, the reason I'm writing right now is because his stories are weird. they make you think ,influence your outlooks heck i would have converted to agniism if I wasn't [redacted] already. they are influential weird that's what gets people talking, sharing and thinking. lastly imma watch the chain saw man anime but the fire punch one would probably give me irreversibly brain damage after 3 episodes.
7/6/2022 2:37:30	The first Tatsuki Fujimoto manga I read was Fire Punch I read the first two chapters and found it extremely boring so I dropped it and after a few months read CSM and enjoyed it thoroughly I found Denji funny and weird and I think it was a fun read but I don't really know what the main point of the manga was and I find that problem in a lot Tatsuki Fujimoto's works. I just don't know what the story is trying to tell me at the end of the day.
7/6/2022 2:44:31	I first came across Fire Punch, and the premise was so original, and did not shy away from being overly brutal, and harsh. I don't know if this makes sense, but the way his works don't shy away from death, injury and pain - it feels so real. I really appreciate him as an author for this quality. This was all what I was first feeling and thinking when I read Fire Punch. It's one of the coolest mangas I've ever encountered.
7/6/2022 2:49:27	Chainsaw man was my second manga right after reading oyasumi punpun, it was fucking awesome and it is my my number one with oyasumi punpun. i love every part of csm and fujimoto’s was of storytelling.
7/6/2022 3:09:52	I came across CSM and I loved the characters. And then I became massive fan of Fujimoto 
7/6/2022 3:13:08	I read CSM, I got hooked from chapter 1, the artwork was some of the best I had ever seen in a manga, and the story was very weird but in a relatable sense like Denji just wanted to touch some boobs and got dragged into a whole new world because of it, he was just a regular guy, just like me for real...and the betrayals and all is something that happens in real life, it felt like a change of pace from the other MCs who are like too unrealistically kind or don't know what they want.
7/6/2022 3:26:16	cool
7/6/2022 4:07:28	Chainsaw man, read it when releasing with forty odd chapters out, around the bomb fiend arc (if that’s around forty chapters I’m not sure) . Wasn’t that enthralled first time round, read it some months later with probably around 20 more chapters out and found it to be the best most insane and novel manga i had read in recent memory. Was absolutely enthralled and read it weekly until it concluded. One of my favourite manga ever. Read fire punch afterwards which was good, but didn’t feel as refined as CSM. Enjoyed it but it was a tad bit too nihilistic for my tastes, still a great read tho. Read look back and then goodbye eri. Look back was enjoyable but I really felt goodbye eri hit differently and is easily my second favourite work of his. Cried a fair bit in goodbye eri.
7/6/2022 4:31:49	I heard of fire punch manga but never bothered to read it coz it's not my type. But when I saw everyone talking about CSM manga I think I should read it it was like my first manga to finsh I think. Even tho my fav is hxh CSM is in my top and is better than hxh no doubt and hype for part 2. And best thing about it is that it should be every emotion listed above. CSN=❤❤
7/6/2022 4:32:24	I first saw the trailer for chainsaw man and thought it looks so cool and I love the artstyle. Currently I read the first 3 volumes of csm and I think I will continue. I can't stand how horny denji is, but the Body Horror and the stories of the other hunters keep me interested. Love your videos 
7/6/2022 4:58:13	Started off with chainsaw man and I was immediately hooked on the premise of a selfish MC. It felt very refreshing to see a character wanting a better life for himself rather than "save the world" or some other good boy MC trope 
7/6/2022 5:00:12	It was chainsaw man, and it was one of the first few manga I read, and it’s my favourite manga. I was encouraged by a few YouTube recommendations and it looked really cool so I thought I’d give it a shot. The organised complex chaos offset with one of the more simple minded and crude main characters was a great juxtaposition of two incredibly fresh story elements I’d never really seen before apart let alone together. The art, bro, it’s literally my phone wallpaper; Denjis devil form shredding through an abhorrent sea of guts just hits different in a way I can never explain all I know is that it makes my brain do the happy things. The devil designs and abstract artwork perfectly convey the cosmic horror of the threats in this manga while still making cohesive character designs that just slap. I also love the characters, despite them all marching around with some of the biggest death flags I have ever seen, Aki, angel, power and reze are all precious characters I wish I had more time with but I hate makima, i despise her further every time I reread thanks to the fact I tried to ignore her being the villain in the first place just like Denji did but that proves what a brilliantly written manipulator and villain she was. The intrigue I have for so many things too: the devils, hell, the gun devil, fiends, the future devil and contracts -  I can’t wait to see how much further it will go along with denji growing as person. All these sentiments simply grow the more I reread it, I did blitz the whole thing in a day without a single break and I have done multiple times since and will do multiple times again because I still manage to see something new, understand something more and find new method in all the madness.   Sorry if this is too long but I will ramble about this masterpiece for ages, and yes it sounds more like a review than a first impression but the first read to me was my first impression due to the fact I never stopped reading it till it’s current end, even so these were roughly the feelings I had up to the restaurant and where denji gets a mouthful of vomit, just slightly weaker and without the added chunks of what the actual fuck and crippling depression yet. Emphasis on the yet.
7/6/2022 5:11:02	First of his works I came across was Chainsaw Man.  I’d be hearing about it for a while and I wanted something to read during my down time, so I decided to go with that.   The total absurdity and nonsensicality of it gave me whiplash for the first couple chapters, but before I knew it I found myself deeply attached to the world and characters.  I think in a way, the insanity of CM allowed me to connect to these characters in a way that I didn’t know could happen so quickly and subtly.  I will forever be a massive fan of Fujimoto’s storytelling and the way he presents his characters and narratives, and he is one of the few authors who I want to experience all the works of.
7/6/2022 5:42:42	The first work I read by Tatsuki Fujimoto was Fire Punch, which was back when it just released its third volume. Right from the first chapter I knew it was something special. I could go on and on about the art, but the story itself struck home to me. It wasn't about some plucky rising hero with a quest to save the day. It started out as someone just trying to survive in a world with no hope, doing whatever they could to keep themselves and there sister alive, no matter the pain. From there I become even more invested into the story. Everything about it was so unique, calling out tropes and just going were it felt life took it. The story felt like it couldn't follow an arch or set path because it wasnt just a story but instead followed these people through there life, which wasn't some glorious time and often left no winners. Agni ( the main person we follow) shows so much about humanity in a real form and how life can genuinely feel. I read a one shot by Tasuki Fujimoto immediately after the last chapter for Fire Punch released and I saw this style of "following the characters and not forcing the characters on a path through life" was almost ingrained in this artist work. The wild antics and breakneck pacing was an amazing bonus, but the stories told hit so hard I knew I would have to read whatever came next, and boy k boy did Chainsaw Man not disappoint.  I could go on a whole separate rant on how Chainsaw Man helped me see problems I had developed in my approach to life and focusing on just surviving instead of enjoying what I could from it, but I wont go that in depth. I'll just end it by saying I love Tatsuki Fujimoto's work, and can honestly say he has effected how I see and handle life with his works. He is an artist in countless areas, but firstly a master of the soul. ( also new to the channel and great stuff so far. I can't wait to see what projects you work on in the future) 
7/6/2022 6:30:57	Fire Punch
7/6/2022 7:26:27	My first experience with Fujimoto's work was reading Chainsaw Man for the first time. From chapter 1, i was already invested and hooked. I loved that it was wacky and cool while also managing to be emotional and fun later on, all at the same time at times. Needless to say, i love his works.
7/6/2022 7:36:18	Chainsaw man, i think chainsaw man was both cool and weird from the story to the art of the manga and can’t wait to see what they do to it for the anime
7/6/2022 8:04:18	I first read CSM, I liked the concept (manifestation of concepts like in monogatari) and thought it was unique.But  after I read Fire Punch I became his fanboy. I dont really get hooked by stories but that hooked me in hard. The more I think about the manga the more it grows on me. Basically what I like about Fujimoto is that he is very very unique and in a good way.
7/6/2022 8:07:57	didnt read 
7/6/2022 8:20:10	I read fire punch and I liked it a lot though the ending and sister stuff I do not like
7/6/2022 8:22:13	The first manga I came across done by Tatsuki Fujimoto was CSM. YouTube was suggesting me videos related to it, but I never cared enough to start reading it. One day I was bored and decided to read it just to pass time, and I ended up loving it. It felt like the fucked up version of a shounen and I thought it was great. I liked the fact that it wasn't too long, it was fast paced, there was a bit of gore, I liked and cared about the characters, I could relate to Denji, the art style is really cool (some panels are breathtaking).
7/6/2022 8:35:29	Chainsaw Man looked scary at first then it became incredibly badass the more I read about it. I thought that the Eternity Devil was possibly one of the final antagonists but as it turns out in volume 3, it got slashed until it begged Denji to put it out of its misery. 
7/6/2022 9:02:24	I discovered him through CSM and got hooked right away. I was really impressed by the amazing paneling and the simple yet functional and unique art style.
7/6/2022 9:03:37	I read Chainsaw Man preparing for the anime and what kept me reading was it being just an absolute fun and wild ride, I've read it twice now and will probably finish it a third time before the anime comes out. 
7/6/2022 9:17:53	My first impression is he is a genius author and he knows very clearly how to portray certain emotions to the pannel and also i also his ideals and motivations to drive his characters. Chainsaw man is simply an amazing series. Yes absolutely it is amazing, cool and marvellous series
7/6/2022 9:26:52	Csm, i just thought it was cool dumb fun, ended up being one of my favorites
7/6/2022 9:35:14	It was Fire Punch and it was amazing
7/6/2022 9:40:51	Oh no this is so sad this boy and his dog got killed by the mob… WAIT WHAT THEY TURNED INTO A CHAINSAW?!?!?! I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING FROM A MANGA CALLED “CHAINSAWMAN”.
7/6/2022 9:57:04	I saw csm first off a scambolia manga recommend video. I thought it was very entertaining and amazing cus first denji is a brand new fresh of air of a shonen mc and the art and gore is so fucking cool. If I were to be ask what's my favorite manga it's always csm. That or gintama lol
7/6/2022 10:02:01	I think CSM and Fire punch had more gore than I could handle but I really liked the one shots especially the most recent one (Just listen to the song),mainly because they had more of a story than the other two. Some of the panels on fire punch were too hard for my big brain to understand. But he is a good mangaka overall 
7/6/2022 10:09:04	First impression when Chainsawman was just expecting some new shounen (same formula but different coat of paint kinda). Till the first arc I was lightly invested, the art looked raw and crude which I liked and the denji and makima pushed me to keep reading (especially makima) and subsequent chapter just got better and better and faster and holy fuck it just go apeshit and I was all in strapped up for the ride. 9/10 must read
7/6/2022 10:28:18	Csm, thought it was very cool although to someone unaware of some classic occurrences in manga it will easily come off as very weird , one of my all time favorites, followed his work because of it, didn't like fire force enough to give it a serious attempt, and good bye eri reinforced my image of him as an amazing mangaka 
7/6/2022 12:09:48	cool.one shot. cool. cool. overall pretty cool
7/6/2022 12:48:36	Amazing weird and funny
7/6/2022 12:53:31	Chainsaw Man was my first. At first I liked his bizarre and gross (in a good way) style in the beginning of the story and one of the first things I noticed about his style was the use of panels in a very "cinematic" way. That was when I found out about his love to cinema and me as a cinema lover as well, was nice to see the scenes in a manga brought up as if they were storyboards for a film. And then I was completely blown away by the obscure, dark, twisted scenes it had towards the end of the manga and all of the horror elements of imagery and sound present in those scenes. I absolutely loved it and CSM stands today as my favorite manga oat.
7/6/2022 13:39:23	The first Tatsuki Fujimoto Manga I read was Chainsaw man. I found it quite entertaining due to its grim and often brutal world, interesting characters, menacing powers, and good humor to boot. 
7/6/2022 14:10:14	Fire punch very quickly reached the top of my manga list. I love things that give me a "What?" feeling like Nickelodeon (and every other Sayman Dowman manga). The whole time reading Fire Punch I was in awe of the art and peculiar ideas that Fujimoto was able to come up with. While similar things can be said about parts of CSM (the half astronauts come to mind) it wasn't as consistently out there. I'm gonna stop here before I start ranting about other strange manga though. Curious to see what you do with this! Have a good one!
7/6/2022 14:10:30	CSM good
7/6/2022 14:21:36	Chainsawman, and it was amazing
7/6/2022 14:28:24	I discovered Tatsuki Fujimoto from his Yogen No Nayuta one-shot. I thought it was really unique and had some cool ideas that it could work off of if it were a full manga, so I decided to check out some of Fujimoto's other stuff, and fell in love with Chainsaw Man. I was very impressed by many things, such as the art, the awesome characters, and how it could go from being hilarious goofy fun to a beautiful emotional rollercoaster. Also seeing Nayuta towards the end was a surprise.  ~Q
7/6/2022 15:03:08	Really interesting 
7/6/2022 15:12:59	My first impressions with Tatsuki Fujimoto's work came with reading Fire Punch. I guess I litterally just saw a thumbnail of an essay on youtube that said something like: "don't watch or read anything about this manga, just read it". And I just went for it.  I was amazed by amount of themes this manga dives really deep into. The way story subverts expectations over and over again was really mindbending to me. Never experienced anything like that.  The artwork amazed me just as much, so I jumped straight into CSM and ended up buying all 11 vol's in japanese, even though I can't even read it (sorta like buying a guitar in hopes to learn how to play it)
7/6/2022 15:13:21	Csm it was deep
7/6/2022 15:22:05	I first read CSM. I had heard about it from a YouTuber that hyped it a lot. Initially, I thought it was over hyped. I figured it was pretty good but still got too much hype regardless. After reading it, I completely agreed that it was in fact under hyped. What really stood out to me was, not only the awesome and crazy art style, but the pacing as well. It was always interesting. Even when the story was between fights or big moments, it never felt dull. Now it's at the same level at FMAB which has been at the top of my list for years now.
7/6/2022 16:12:04	The first manga from him that i saw was fire punch and i read the first chapter. I thought it was kinda weird cause his sister wanted to fuck him and that... so i dropped it but i alo thought is was funny. His first manga that i read completly was cm and i instantly fell in love with it. I love the characters the story the art... EVERYTHING!! It was funny cool weird AMAZING!! When i finished the manga it was officially my fav manga. I loved everything about it and i cant wait for pt 2.  I also finished fire punch and i think the manga is grear. The humor and the art is great, but cm ia better. Ps: Love your vids. PPs: power best
7/6/2022 16:40:15	Fire punch, saw it in a manga store. Bought to volumes and I personally found them to be total garbage. Not my type of genre at all!
7/6/2022 17:49:18	my first encounter with tatsuki fujimoto was the youtube video of a 4chan greentext edit of the american psycho "huey lewis" scene. i thought that if one anon can rant on about it for that long i might as well give it a try. i started with fire punch and was immediately surprised by how different it was from other manga i'd read. much darker straight from the get go. after crying at least once i moved on to CSM and that completely sold me on the guy, he's a modern master, one of the greats. i hope his life is prosperous.
7/6/2022 17:59:24	Definitely the art style. The first manga I read from Tatsuki Fujimoto is Chainsaw Man. It was intense, funny, amazing and overall WUF WUF.  
7/6/2022 18:12:01	The first thing I read by him was fire punch and at the part with the dogs I closed the tab and went back to continue a month later 
7/6/2022 18:13:08	The dude's mental. Chainsaw man first. It's cool, dumb, weird, funny, and amazing.
7/6/2022 18:19:07	The first thing I read of his was fire punch. I thought it was so fucked and sad, but the beauty of the art kept me reading.
7/6/2022 18:31:08	Chainsaw Man was the first work by Tatsuki Fujimoto that I've read.   I'm probably in the minority here but I do not like Chainsaw Man when I first tried it. I wouldn't call it "bad" but it was just not my cup of tea.  And here's the thing: I tried reading and getting into it three separate times. But it just did not click with me and still doesn't.  I think it mostly comes down to a couple main reasons: One is that I strongly dislike the protagonist. I've never been a fan of the "dumb but strong" type of protagonist but Denji takes it to a whole new level. There was not a single point where I liked seeing him "on screen" and I generally just found his personality annoying. That's not to say I don't 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥 his character. I just... didn't like him. I didn't like Power either for similar reasons. In general I didn't have any character in the series I particularly liked which is rare for me.  The other main reason that I think I didn't enjoy the manga was the chaotic and strange nature of Chainsaw Man as a whole. Something about the pacing? To be honest I'm not sure, maybe just a bit TOO insane for me?  That's all I can think of. I'll probably still give the anime a try and maybe I'll be able to enjoy it in that format.  P.S: Might not be relevant but I will mention that I REALLY like Dandadan and I've heard many people say that if you like Chainsaw Man then you'll like Dandadan and vice-versa. But I only liked Dandadan. I'll also mention that I've very much enjoyed Tatsuki Fujimoto's one-shots. Just Chainsaw Man in particular was not my thing.
7/6/2022 18:54:51	My first piece of work from Fujimoto that I read was Chainsaw man, and my first impression was that it was bat sh*t crazy. All I knew going into it was that Chainsaw man had a cult following who said it was great, so the first chapter alone piqued my interests. It's awesome, gory, funny as hell while also being tragic and sad. With characters that are so different from regular life people, for Fujimoto to still be able to make us feel what they are feeling is a testament to his work. I love Chainsaw man and I'm for sure going to read his other works soon.
7/6/2022 19:36:52	I had heard about Fujimoto for Chainsaw Man when it was on the rise, but my first experience of his works was his one-shot "Goodbye Eri" which had single-handedly made me a fan of his work and writing, but what I feel best describes Fujimoto would be his most talked about series Chainsaw Man which I had read after. And I then saw with my two eyes just how amazing he was at writing stories and twisting plots. Chainsaw Man had moved me in a way i wasn't expecting because as someone who had experienced loss at a young age, the hate I had seen in Aki really struck a chord with me and made me rethink how I was when growing up. And the "Bang" panel makes me think to other shonen series held in high prestige such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, specifically part 7, because of how little 'plot armor' main characters have in both series. Without writing an entire essay on how much I love Fujimoto's works I feel that they can, as far as I've read, be described as masterpieces. Fire Punch may change that as it was his first major serialized manga but I feel he will still tell a great story even with that. Fujimoto is really a one in a million guy.
7/6/2022 20:00:32	Chainsaw Man is immaculate and one of the best pieces of fiction I've experienced. Reading it had me shocked because I had no clue what I was getting into all I knew was that it was insane. Also Makima is Mommy. I also read Goodbye Eri which in my opinion sucked. I thought the writing was alright, but it wasn't great. Maybe it was because I was sick but I just thought it was stupid. But I'm excited to read part 2 of Chainsaw Man and Fire Punch.
7/6/2022 20:00:53	My first exposure to Fujimoto was Chainsaw Man, it was recommended to me by Tik Tok and I searched the summary on Wikipedia to know what the fuck it's about. And it sounded generic and boring as fuck, next thing you know You Tube recommends me an edit of the Hamburger Family chapter and Kobeni dancing and I just had to know what the fuck is up.   Fast forward to me reading chapter one, a double spread of Denji fighting a horde of zombies, just tearing and ripping them to pieces, and I fell in love. From there I was captivated by one of fiction's most peculiar protagonist. And his famous catchphrase: I want to touch some boobs.   Fujimoto is an expert in taking a basic concept, a guy with chainsaw hands or a guy on fire and just tear into their psychology, their life, who are they friends with, their love life. He tells amazing stories that just make me want to create something that cool. 
7/6/2022 21:04:00	Fun and i was there on chainsawman ending started with csm and the one shots
7/6/2022 22:21:09	The first manga I read by him was CSM, but I have also read Fire Punch. My first thoughts were how weird it was. The main character was not the normal shounen Mc that I had imagined. Both series had a much more dark stories that brought me back to reality sometimes. The characters had flaws and the art was beautiful. Throughout reading I was absolutely entrapped in the plot. Some of the more disturbing parts were added so well and it didn't just feel like horror with no plot. I loved both series and Tatsuki Fujimoto will remain one of my favorite mangaka.
7/6/2022 23:14:17	Chainsaw man and it was like nothing I had read before
7/6/2022 23:21:06	I’m Muslim 
7/6/2022 23:47:12	Fire Punch. Rather wierd manga, but the plot kept me interested, and sometimes it was touching
7/6/2022 23:58:39	CSM. Pretty epic
7/7/2022 0:29:44	Fire Punch Cool - art, character design (depth, motivation)  Weird & amazing - story progression, ending
7/7/2022 0:37:48	I had quiet a lot of experience with anime and manga but when I first started to read chainsaw man I felt the same as ever. Yeah sure it was a interesting setting and plot but it wasn't that special. Just some typical shounen. Well everything changed when Himeno died basically out of nowhere. In other works I read to this time, characters didn't die without some huge build up SPOILER (ace death at marine fort for example) but killing a character who just got introduced like 20 chapters ago was really surprising to me. From there on I kept reading but it kinda felt like a fever dream. I had the same experience with fire punch aswell. I really love both stories but the first time I read them it felt like I was experiencing something unreal after thinking about fujimotos works a bit I think thats the thing why I love his stories so much. He presents things that anyone can agree or connect with but still makes it feel outta world. 
7/7/2022 0:44:32	The first work of Tatsuki Fujimoto I read was Chainsaw Man, because I heard it was a great manga, one of the most influencial of the last years, but when I started it I felt confused and bored, I feel I didn´t paid real attention to a lot of things going on, also the start seem a bit slow to me (maybe because at start Denji doesn´t have a "great motivation", but now I think that´s something special about this character that in other way wouldn´t be as effective as it is). I drop it when Reze reveals her devil form and start attacking Denji and other hunters. Some time later I read Goodbye Eri and thought it was amazing, and with the news of the Chainsaw Man anime adaptation, I decide to give it another try, so I started reading it again and this time it hooked me up. I´m still reading it, being currently in chapter 80 
7/7/2022 1:06:00	Truly fucking nuts, I read chainsaw man, and its what kinda ignited my love for manga, right after reading Chainsaw Man I read through all of Fire punch and every one shot fujimoto released in a single week. Fujimotos work sets the standard for what I consider a good manga now.  P.S. Read Golden Kamuy, it's peak manga
7/7/2022 2:47:40	I came across Chainsawman first because of Makima fan art. I then read some chapters and instantly got in to it. The first things I noticed reading his work is that the atmosphere he likes to build are Dark and Grim, a type of atmosphere that puts you on edge.
7/7/2022 2:48:19	When I first found Chainsaw man I felt like I found something really different, it's kinda hard to put in words but it had some quality that made it stand out to me. I've read a little bit of fujimoto's other work, again all with a feeling of being a step out of the ordinary. Over all all the work that comes from fujimoto will always entertain and excite me. 
7/7/2022 2:59:09	I came across CSM and Fire punch both at the same time because their covers looked pretty cool! Idk why but it took me a long time to realize that it was by the same author (sue me I read it in an illegal site cause it's hard to come across physical copies where I'm from). At first I thought that it was pretty goofy, I mean where can you see such blatant ero in a shounen??? It was the first time for me so my impressions of CSM was that it wouldn't be as amazing. But boy was I in for a ride~
7/7/2022 3:00:28	Edgy in a cringe way but made sense
7/7/2022 3:16:06	I read Chainsaw Man first, because after reading the Jujutsu Kaisen manga it was strongly recommended to me by a few people, I haven’t read Fire Punch or his One-Shots. Because of the recommendations being based off the Jujutsu Kaisen manga I had really high hopes for what the manga would be like with stuff like art, characters, and story. My first impression outside of that was the panel of Denji crouched over the magazines talking about tits. Really lived up to my expectations though, and the goofy art style actually works for the depressing ass tone towards the end. The honestly stupid interactions between Denji and Aki is what really sold me on reading the manga though,  and wanting to see how Denji’s dumbassery could actually help him through the battles that are honestly scary first time around because you literally can’t tell if he’s going to die because everyone else dies as well. When first reading I thought it was a really silly fun-read with some cool concepts but by the end I thought it was fucking fantastic. Chainsaw Man’s one of my favourite manga because everything used for the story just manages to work so well together
7/7/2022 3:39:51	Chainsaw man. The humour, pace and plot:action ratio just scratched every itch 
7/7/2022 3:47:57	It was chainsaw man and I thought it was stupid but a Loveable and deep stupid that I enjoy reading 
7/7/2022 3:55:16	csm, cool. At first I read first 9 ch then dropped it, then 9 months later I picked it up again and it was amazing. csm is my top 10 manga that made me cry. Then, on april this year, I read sayonara eri, it was beautifully written. It felt like watching a good movie. I never knew a oneshot can be that good.I put sayonara eri at 9.8/10 and csm 9.7/10 
7/7/2022 4:28:35	The first fujimoto work I read was CSM (go figure) and at first I needed to force myself to read the first 10 or so chapters so I could just get a hold of what exactly I was reading. The chaos, gore and quirkyness kind of reminded me of Dorohedoro , a manga that I read before CSM and that I like A LOT. Once you realize what you're in for with CSM, you grow to really like it, it's an enjoyable and fun story with a lot left up to the reader to decipher. After CSM I got and read Fire Punch and that series is kindaaa weird. It's still somewhat enjoyable but for me, there was definitely more disinterest in the story and the characters than there was in CSM (CSM characters were super likeable and unique). After that I read Goodbye Eri and what else to say other than; it was beautiful and as cliched as it may be, it really felt like a movie.
7/7/2022 4:36:30	Chainsaw Man… and it was… really something. Something amazing, of course… but damn. It made me feel empty sometimes, especially in regards to the characters. It made me feel like everything was so fleeting and that life was devoid of any importance. The setting was fucking surreal, with environments like the Infinite Hotel or the realm of the Darkness Devil, made me experience a type of horror and anxiety that i have never experience in any other work… maybe apart from Fire Punch, which gave a different set of chills (Read that shit afterwards, and it’s still scrambling, what is now, my mushy brain). And at the same time… is so bonkers and nonsensical, its silly. Every time i thought i got a accustomed to the world and its insanity… SIKE, BITCH!! BIG FUCKING TORNADO BABY VS SHARK BOY AND MOTOR-AX MAN… or like… LUSTFUL ZOMBIE GIRL HAS CTHULLU LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE SMARTEST BEING IN THE UNIVERSE!! (or at least is the one that knows all of it). It’s crazy… crazy good. I love the laughts, the anxiety, the tears and the Awes it made me feel. To say it was a great read would be an understatement, but that’s the best i can summarize.
7/7/2022 5:17:36	Chainsaw man, read it in a whole night, was like "what the fuck happened" then i started doubting of myself, my life, my friend ecc. But overall wierd/amazing/funny/sad
7/7/2022 5:21:50	Chainsawman. I followed it from the very beginning of its serialisation because some of my pals were into Firepunch. I thought it was a fresh new direction for shōnen storytelling developing right in front of my eyes. Definitely a unique way to engage someone. I hope it helps the genre evolve. I also wonder if it means my level of investment in his storytelling will taper off as he’s now more established. Oh well time will tell. 
7/7/2022 5:40:16	Breath taking
7/7/2022 5:42:09	CSM
7/7/2022 6:05:14	I read chainsaw man and loved it. It helped get me back into Manga.
7/7/2022 6:18:50	Chainsawman. Very cool, weird, fun, funny. Interesting plot twists
7/7/2022 6:24:45	CSM. It was really good, mostly comedic and dumb but also cool
7/7/2022 7:04:33	Felt weird but really fun Chainsaw man was my first intro 
7/7/2022 7:26:11	I read chainsaw man because I was was in a horror manga mood after I read Devilman, and heard Chainsaw man was really good. When I read it I thought it was nuts and over the top. Fujimoto really likes to do weirder story’s based on some of the one shots of his I have read since and Chainsaw man really feels like he is marrying it to a shounen structure
7/7/2022 7:44:00	 I've read pretty much everything he's put out but my first time reading a manga of his was fire punch it's pretty much the main reason I got into manga in the first place, it was just so insane I had to check out other manga, plus after finishing chainsaw man he easily became my favorite author 
7/7/2022 8:24:50	The first Tatsuki Fujimoto work that I read was CSM. I was completely enthralled by his panels, how everything flowed and how easy it was to piece all the panels and getting it moving in my head. To put it shortly I think it’s a masterpiece. Something I love about his works is the surreal element on them, it’s seen more on fire punch than chainsaman, but it’s his metaphors that he uses them for that I like, just like the cinema scenes in fire punch or the scenes in look back where she imagines herself attacking the killer. Another cool thing to see in his works is his love of film and all the inspiration he takes from them. The stories of his works are also really good. For example in fire punch I like how he dealt with the roles and expectations that came from them, which is something that a lot of characters deal with. Agni with being the hero and what that entails and also being a leader later on, and there are others examples as well, like judah, doma, neneto and even togata.
7/7/2022 9:03:17	The first story i came across was fire-punch, and over all i thought it was interesting but underwhelming. Mainly due to a feeling of incoherence throughout the story and an ending which i felt didnt tie the story together. However i did not judge Fujimoto harshly as it was clear that he was still trying to learn his craft and find his voice and style. Overall as in all his works their were many ideas of interest and solid art.   Next i read chainsaw man and really enjoyed that. CSM still retains a mild sense of incoherence at times, but this now lends itself to the story and the chaos of it making it an effective story telling aspect rather than a distracting one. Overall the story is tied together much more cleanly, with clear development in the mc.   The strongest aspect of CSM is clearly the characters, and it is Fujimotos greatest strength as a writer. Displaying characters which exhibit nuanced emotions, and using random and bizarre scenarios as vehicles for their emotional journeys. He has made his once incoherent storytelling his strength.   I respect Fujimotos dedication to overall story and experience rather than to art alone, as many great mangaka can sometimes do. Nihei's influence is very clear on Fujimoto and i think he also improves on Niheis storytelling style by adding a fuller and clearer narrative to his stories. But i dont think his art in any way rivals any of the greatest managaka by any means.   I think that Fujimoto is an exciting creator overall and i look forward to his next works. I do not believe he has fully matured or reached his limit, nor do i think CSM will be his best work. Overall i like CSM very much, but it is not original in any way, it simply does all of the things in manga we have seen before very well, and in an enjoyable way. I do like CSM but it is very derivative and i believe it is slightly over hyped, simply because it is fresh, holds promise and is better than most of the current manga surrounding it - but i dont think that alone makes it objectively a great manga to rival the best the medium has to offer.   I look forward to watching Fujimoto improve, and i am respectful and grateful for his efforts as i am of all mangaka, even the lowliest. I deeply appreciate the sacrifice and dediciation that they embody.   Thank you  
7/7/2022 9:05:21	CSM
7/7/2022 10:03:27	Chainsaw man was my first tatsuki fujimoto manga.  I started reading it and i dont know how much time it took i caughtup with it and was recommending it to my friends left and right
7/7/2022 10:13:19	I thought it was bizarre and experimental(CSM) in a way, but done very well, and at times brilliantly. 
7/7/2022 10:23:58	honestly when reading csm for the first time like a week before the final chapter released, to keep it simple my journey basically went "damn shit keeps happening and the shit thats happening is fucking awesome haha these characters are funny i love them." and then csm goes from a 10 to 11 and characters i care about start dying and its equally as awesome and sad. and then i start reading his other stuff, which most of the time is always equally insane but equally emotionally poignant.
7/7/2022 10:33:21	I first came across Fujimoto through Chainsaw Man, and I thought it was, for one thing, really f*cking entertaining, but I also felt that it had a lot of feeling behind it. It struck this weird balance of both dumb fun without a care in the world, and treating every little thing as if it were the last thing in the world that mattered - if that makes any sense. At the time it just had me wiping away tears while yelling "JUST PICK A STYLE FFS" into my phone screen, although I now of course know that that was just Fujimoto toying with me like the puppet master he is. It was beautiful, in a sense. It was able to keep me hooked even through all of the emotional pain I would go through every chapter. It almost made me hooked on the pain... That came out wrong. But I'm not sure how else to put it. Fujimotos works have this uncanny ability to get me all invested and having fun despite being incredibly dark. They prove to me that I can be a dopamine-chasing ape and yet still be able to really feel things and have empathy.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
7/7/2022 10:59:29	I've read both Fire Punch and Chainsaw Man; My interest in anime has dwindled over time in the midst of all the "ecchi/soft hentai" Isekai and action/adventure shows coming out- not to discredit them for they are popular, but they just aren't my cup of tea per se. FP was a rollercoaster of emotions, seeing as it was one of his first works, I think it was Fujimoto's diamond in the rough- unpolished around the edges but just needing a little something to push it over the edge to greatness. It wasn't a terrible manga by any means and I think it was really cool, it dealt with such heavy topics such as existentialism, immortality and the burdens that come with it and much more! As for CSM.. phew boy, that manga really tore me a new one. When Ah Lecks mentioned he cried during the snowball fight between Aki and Denji, I was sobbing right along with him. I think Fujimoto really hit the mark on CSM, it was an amazing narrative he was able to pick us up with and hit the floor running. The ability to create such a diverse and intriguing universe with his characters and story really shone in this one, he had for sure leveled up since his time with FP. Sadly, I haven't read any of his other one-shots yet, but because of CSM and FP I really do now want to.
7/7/2022 11:11:30	Chainsaw Man
7/7/2022 11:49:18	"Fujimoto is a damn GENIUS", was my first impression of him after reading Chainsaw man. I mean like this man made a story about this guy with a chainsaw on his head fighting demons and stuff and still some how made it into an emotional roller coaster of a story. All in all Fujimoto is now one of my favorite mangaks's. Hopefully part 2 of Chainsaw man is crazier and better than the first but in the end i'll appreciate what ever we end up getting.
7/7/2022 11:54:26	It was CSM and it was really cool, actually it was 1st manga i read. Then i looked into Fire Punch and i really didn't like it, i couldn't go past 10th chapter  
7/7/2022 12:12:38	CSM, thought it was weird af
7/7/2022 12:15:53	The first manga by Tasuki Fujimoto I read was chainsaw man. From the first couple of pages I felt this manga had a lot of potential. And boy did it deliver. The story was everything I wanted it to be. Basically a mindfuck, but also a cohesive story. I personally really like the art style. It isn't anything mindblowing like say berserk, but it definitely stood out from the rest, which I think is why it caught my attention in the first place. So for me I basically immediately fell in love with his work. Definitely looking forward to CSM part 2 and the anime.
7/7/2022 12:35:33	My first impression was coming across chainsaw man, i wasn't really into reading manga but chainsaw man really showed me how fun a manga can be. It has all the things a person can like in a story with cool yet some what deep characters, emotional moments, hype, etc. Definitely one of my favourite manga's starting off from.
7/7/2022 13:16:26	It was fire punch and it was like being manhandled by insanity that I grew to enjoy
7/7/2022 13:58:42	Chainsaw man, I thought it was hilarious how out of control denji was and how all solutions were absolutely bonkers at first. And yet as the series progresses I became more and more anxious like "oh shit, things are getting serious" it was no longer fun dying, important characters would go down and you'll never see them again. Then poor aki… it went from a manga about a boy who wants to fuck to a manga about a boy who wants to fuck with more meaning behind it, seeing a meaning to life. Later on i read all of available one-shots all of them still holding that usual level of absurdity but in a nice and comforting way. Knowing this is truly Tatsuki Fujimoto
7/7/2022 14:41:13	Live
7/7/2022 14:43:58	Fire Punch, thought is was crazy, disturbing, thought provoking
7/7/2022 15:11:50	I thought it was cool tbh when I first read chainsaw man I was like this is cool I didn’t really have a outrageous reaction to the stuff that was happening like a lot of the community. Solid 7/10 on the first read 8/10 on the second but I think he’s a solid author who’s good at making characters stick to you and stories you can easily immerse yourself in.
7/7/2022 15:42:37	It was fire punch , at first it seemed chaotic and the story not so well made but after i kept reading boi i was flabbergasted , the story telling was so engaging i finished the manga in one day , iss emotionally engaging aswell . Fire punch was amazing *chef’s kiss* 
7/7/2022 15:44:24	So, Chainsaw Man was actually my first Jump manga that I started reading from Day 1. It had an okay start, but it didn’t blow my socks off. I remember the crazy image of him transforming and tearing through those guys. Then, the bat devil arc with Power. I think the part where I knew things were weird was when they got stuck in that building and eyepatch lady just…died. It really surprised me. I have an interesting perspective on the series, being able to read it with each week. I knew it was good, but it’s hard to see just HOW good until you reread the entire thing. So, so many iconic and crazy moments. But, yeah, I think I just thought it was a bit edgy. Makima was kind of weird but whatever. And the boob thing was just odd.😂
7/7/2022 16:38:46	I read chainsaw man first and i liked it but didn’t really enjoy the story at first read because I got super confused around the Santa Clause arc. After I reread and read some explanations I really enjoyed it. The arts fantastic and I enjoyed it wasn’t a protagonist with the standard revenge for family motive. Thought it did break my heart when Makima killed Power and Aki. Power is still best girl even after dying tho
7/7/2022 16:41:38	Different
7/7/2022 16:58:45	CSM. It was fun and I liked it, it was weird and quirky without trying too hard. It’s not as epic as it could be but it was a fun read and I’d recommend it. 7.5 / 10
7/7/2022 17:09:09	Chainsaw Man was my first Fujimoto work, and I thought it was refreshing awesomeness. It was one of the only pieces of written media that I found myself binge-ing for hours. I then went on to read Fire Punch, and while not as appealing initially, I have come to love it. 
7/7/2022 17:32:55	strangely unique
7/7/2022 18:16:04	For me the first manga of Fujimoto was CSM and I loved it back in 2019. Since then he is my favorite  mangaka and his works are amazing. I am waiting every day on the next part of CSM and the anime. I have never seen  his style in manga or anime and thats why I find that he is one of the greatest mangaka
7/7/2022 18:17:57	Chainsaw Man was my first Tatsuki Fujimoto manga, and it was really, REALLY cool, and weird, and funny. It overall was a fantastic read and I loved every bit of it. Great characters, Jaw dropping art all fitted together with a strange, yet really fun story. Easy 10/10
7/7/2022 18:50:59	Fire Punch. At the time I read it completely through then about a year later I read it again. The best way to describe his work would be; rather than hiding meanings within words, he buries them under insanity. I still think he's crazy though. I read all his stuff.
7/7/2022 19:25:22	Interesting, different, and intriguing 
7/7/2022 20:04:13	I discovered Chainsaw Man through a meme online and decided to pick it up as my very first manga. What drew me in at first was the weird absurdity of the concept, however after reading the first chapter I was surprised with the serious and badass story. By the end, I had read what I believed was a beautiful representation of what an action manga can be. From the symbolism to the characters and art, CSM got me into reading manga and made me appreciate Tatsuki Fujimoto very much for his creativity and depth in his works.
7/7/2022 20:06:49	read CSM first, thought it’s way to create different endings to arcs such as the reze and international assassin arcs sick. Then read fire punch and it really resonated with me. Cool world, cool characters and cool story 
7/7/2022 20:23:27	CSM, at first I thought it was cool but not what I expected by all the hype, then I got further into it and the world got crazier, the fights and characters were good and then I was hit by the gun devil arc… yeah I then saw what the hype was about I love CSM
7/7/2022 20:39:07	My first impression of tatsuki fujimoto came from reading chainsawman. Chainsaw is one of if not my favourite manga of all time(tied with berserk) and there are many things i love about it. Chainsaw man’s wacky comedic and blunt storytelling style is what stood out to me. Crazy shit happens and thats just how shit goes. I love how realistic of a main character denji is and how brutal the world of chainsaw man is. It is as dark as berserk but doesn’t take itself to seriously or try to come of as poetic or deep even if it is.  After chainsaw i read fire punch and it was even more ridiculous than chainsaw man.   Tatsuki fujimotto is my 2nd fav mangaka (after kentaro miura). Stories like chainsaw man and fire punch are not stories a mentally stable person can make and i love how his personality shines through in his work
7/7/2022 21:58:34	I read Chainsaw man when it had just 20 chapters and caught up to it the night I started it. I thought that despite it being an absurd and entertaining series that it also had a lot of heart put into it.
7/7/2022 22:07:35	Weird and amazing, it was csm, top 3 mangas, it is above amazing
7/7/2022 22:15:03	Well when I first heard about chainsaw man from others that time the manga was getting hype among my colleagues so that fueled my interest to also start the manga...at first the artsyle looked good and the story was also good but with every chapter both the artsyle and story became more better and better and amazing. The fighting scenes were top-notch. In one word I feel Tatsuki Fujimoto is a one of the goat mangakas.  P.S. You make good videos bro keep up the good work :)
7/7/2022 23:36:36	It was cool. Chainsaw Man. It was amazing 
7/7/2022 23:41:05	CSM. It was the most fun I'd had in a while. A manga about utterly insane people where being insane was a requirement for their job. Many of the themes went over my head upon first read, but the sheer coolness of it all is more than enough to carry you through the whole first part to its end. All the character complexities and themes are just reasons to go back.
7/7/2022 23:47:15	It was chainsaw man and it got me into manga it was just so different and interesting 
7/8/2022 0:55:56	My first impression was this is the greatest I will ever read in my lifetime.
7/8/2022 2:23:13	My first encounter with Fujimoto's work was with Fire Punch Man. I thought that the art style was intrguing as it's more coarse than your typical "shonen" artstyle. It reminds little bit of Junji Ito's artstyle. I really liked the concept and the worldbuilding of Fire punch man, but I feel the story was rushed.
7/8/2022 4:18:56	CSM. Read it in one go (had a 24 hour shift), was amazed by the stupidity and how action-packed this manga was. 
7/8/2022 5:06:00	First I read was CSM. It was weird enough but it had a good ending OF DENJI DOING LITERAL CANNIBALISM. But yeah it didn't really emotionally impact me.  What did were his both one shots. Goodbye, Eri is a masterpiece, 1000/10.
7/8/2022 5:12:17	I read CSM this year because of all the hype, and it was amazing. I really liked how the main character wasn't your average goody-two-shoes who used the power of friendship, and was some dude who wanted mommy milkers. also i read Look Back and it was great and it was actually emotional 
7/8/2022 6:10:31	Cool and weird in a good way 
7/8/2022 6:17:51	bizarre and entrenching building up to an aura of excitement. this was my first impression of chainsaw man, my first of fujimoto's works i read.   
7/8/2022 6:31:29	CSM was the first manga by Fujimoto that I read. My honest first impressions of CSM were "This is literally Jujutsu Kaisen, but better".   CSM was pretty cool, because it made me feel lots of stuff. I like Denji. Denji isn't kindhearted or intelligent like typical protagonists. He's not badass. He's not cool. He's kinda dumb. He goes through horrible shit for no reason. He gets manipulated. I like that he is a bit simpleminded. I like his development, although I can't really explain wtf his development was.  I liked the moments where Denji was happy, because it also made me happy.  Thanks for coming to my TED-talk
7/8/2022 6:58:06	My first work of his was Chainsaw Man, I read it while it was still running (I think it was right at the end of the International Assassins arc). At first I feel in love with the rough art style and comedy of it, but during the bomb devil arc I realized just how well written the Series is. Up to that point it honestly felt very juvenile to me, but that was the first Arc that felt well written. During the international Assassins Arc (in particular the Scenes in Hell) and in the Gun Devil Arc (everything from the reveal of how many people died, too Aki's death and fantasy with his brother to, most heartbreakingly, Powers death), I saw more that Fujimoto is only good to ok at writing, but they uses Page Layouts and the Imagery to elevate their stories to a higher level. The perfect encapsulation of this are the Short Stories, where the writing is very simple, but the way the story is presented completely carries it.
7/8/2022 7:33:45	CSM. Very weird but in a good way. Super awesome 
7/8/2022 8:53:54	It was CSM and I loved the chaotic and horror vibes
7/8/2022 9:37:08	The first one I read was Chainsaw Man. A t first I thought it was just a normal shounen with a little more gore than usual and I didn't mind that but as the story progressed İ was captivated by the charecters and the way they interacted. The worldbuilding was kinda confusing but I didn't really try to understand it and tried to focus more on the characters and it led me to having a better experiance I think. When I firs tread Chainsaw Man I didn't have any expectations  and I'm glad I didn't have any because it would kinda ruin my view of the thing. My impression of the manga changed as the story proggress and now it's a reallyy good story that I would problaly never re-read. In'm excited for part 2 but I don't have that many expectations I'm happy if we even have Denji in it. (Sorry for the bad writing. English isn't my first language.)
7/8/2022 10:34:57	the first thing i fully read was goodbye eri and i was really moved. i has read some csm but i wasn’t interested tbh. from the subtle difference and gentle use in the art to the panels and almost frame like pages, i truly saw a mangaka that was incredibly creative, thoughtful, and careful with his artwork.
7/8/2022 11:17:12	Chainsaw Man was the first work of Fujimoto I had read back in late 2020. I hadn't read much manga back then and was fairly new to the medium, so I was open to anything and didn't even have many expectations for it. But it blew the expectations I didn't even have and was hooked from the jump (hehe). It still remains one of my favorite manga and it's probably the most fun I had reading something in general from start til finish. It was everything you wanted and could want: cool, dumb, weird, funny, amazing and garbage, things that you wouldn't expect to mix well, but it just works with Fujimoto. His creative genius goes through the roof. So all in all, pretty good.
7/8/2022 11:43:32	I've read fire punch and CSM, so here is my opinion on both. Imo, fire punch started out ok as a story, but later on I felt like the plot just crumbled away. Every new development felt completely random and I never felt like it was building towards something. I wish the story had better direction, because I definitely felt it could've been better. One thing Fire punch tried to do was establish several dark themes in its stories, but in the end everything just came out as a really weird read.  CSM on the other hand, was much more fun to read. To me, it was a quirky and funny read that had a much more refined plot than fire punch, had a much more refined world than fire punch, and had much better characters than fire punch. I also liked that the plot was much more streamlined (the authors had a better idea of where it was going?), and that the art was better. In the end, I didn't like fire punch because everything just felt completely random, but CSM imo had a story to tell and it did it well.
7/8/2022 12:58:27	first time was CSM and not long after I finished reading that I quickly moved on to Fire Punch. First impression was that it was cool, dumb, weird, funny and amazing all at the same time. There was a fricking dude turning into a chainsaw, even though he was as smart as a brick, there was Power suddenly killing a dude with Kobeni's car and blaming her, and the awesome fights (especially with Aki, he's so cool) and as for Fire Punch I just think it was so amazing that I can't even properly put into words how much I like it. 
7/8/2022 13:07:09	It was chainsawman and I simply thought that everything was really weird. But I just could not stop reading. 
7/8/2022 13:37:47	Im not usually the manga guy, more like an anime guy, so I barely know any authors. I even had to search what fujimoto did and found out I read one of his works, Chainsaw Man. When my friends kept recommending me to read it. I thought it would be just a normal JJK style manga. Mc gets possesed by a devil proceeds to use it to kill other devils. But I was so wrong.jThe Art Style was nice but what really enticed me is the way he just kills supporting characters like they are nothing. It is such a bold move for me coming from animes where little to no supporting characters die. It introduced me to a part of anime and manga that is gore and traumatizing. I do think stumbling on his works was the best thing I ever did on my years of watching anime and reading manga. To put it in words it was cool and interesting.
7/8/2022 15:04:15	I first came across FIRE PUNCH around 2021 when a friend recommended it i read the first chapter, thought it was a good niche fun shonen then continued to forget about it for all eternity until i got a new message from my friend "FUCKING READ NOW!!!!!!! and there was the link to chainsaw man" and holy fucking shit i read the first few chapters up until the Bat devil fight and thought to myself shit man its 3am and continued to read it and at first i thought its gonna be some disgusting shut-ins dream to finally touch some grass and get bitches but man. Tatsuki Fujimoto made me rethink my basis for a good manga his stories are full of amazingly thought-out plot twists and he puts so much thought into his characters i can easily write a 700 page essay on Angel and Aki's relationship and a 1700 essay on reze and denji. HE IS SOOO FUCKING COOL I WANT TO KISS HIM TYSM FOR SUCK GOOD MANGASS♡♡♡♡♡
7/8/2022 17:26:15	my first and only series for now that I read from him is Fire Punch. as a first impression of it I can say that it was definitely a fresh change from what I have read before and one of the first introductions to the seinen mangas. what captivated me was it's message that build upon it's story and tried to send to the readers. rarely where a manga deeply explore he theme of the purpose of living and how to live with the mistakes you make that stays a hurdle in each step. the story overall was amazing with some weirdness sprinkled in it. had some dumb moment.  
7/8/2022 19:40:19	I initially started reading Chainsaw Man on Shonen Jump because I thought the title was funny. This was before it really blew up and I had never heard of Fujimoto's work prior, so I was going in blind. Within the first chapter I knew I had stumbled upon something special. Fujimoto has a way of conveying messages in a very strange and unique way that really draws me in. He also manages the write characters that actually feel like real people. Tatsuki Fujimoto is easily one of my favorite manga authors and I think the first part of Chainsaw Man is some top tier Shonen. 
7/8/2022 19:51:03	My first experience of Fujimoto came from Chainsaw Man. It was weird, funny, and completely unlike anything(aside from maybe JoJo’s) I had ever read before. CSM quickly became my favorite manga of all time and I read Fire Punch and every one shot I could find of his and I could tell you it was no fluke. Fujimoto is a god. Possibly a god of chaos and insanity, but a god indeed. 
7/8/2022 19:51:46	A mandala who doesn’t waste time getting to the point and is able to create likeable and relatable characters with a unique way of storytelling reminiscent of Tarantino flicks
7/8/2022 19:58:22	csm. i thought it was a really cool concept and i really liked the art on the tomato devil, so i kept reading
7/8/2022 20:26:57	I read fire punch first, and once I got past the incest at the beginning, I realized it was a great story and world. Once I heard chainsaw man was by the same author, I finished all 80 chapters (that were released at the time) in one day. One of my favorite mangakas of all time no doubt.
7/8/2022 20:41:44	For me the first Tatsuki fujimoto experience was Fire Punch and I caught up to it when chapter 37 was published and for me it was bizzare, weird but stiil it was entertaining as fuck (and heartbreaking and painful at times) 
7/8/2022 22:25:36	It was Chainsawman. I thought it was unique. The flow of the anime and how fast paced it was got me really going. I also liked how you would have no idea what next chapter would bring or which characters would survive. 
7/8/2022 23:30:36	First Impression: I ended up starting with chainsaw man and my first impressions were that it was an above average Shonen jump series that had great art, and it was a creative and funny.   Rant I ended up writing:   :) However, as I continued reading, it felt different from other manga. The character wasn't a hero, which isn't entirely original, but it felt like he shows the events from how the main character views and experiences the world and not just the main character being the focus like other series. It gives his works a very human charm were it shows the cool, dumb, weird, and garbage that happens to someone. sayonara eri being a good example of this or even fire punch.
7/8/2022 23:37:36	Chainsaw Man was the first manga I read from Fujimoto. My friends recommended Chainsaw Man to me and so I gave it a try and I thought it was going to be amazing. I read it and thought it was okay but Denji became my favorite character in all of manga. I loved Denji so much I bought all 11 volumes of CSM and reread it. When I reread CSM on the physical copies it was a totally different experience. The face expressions, the small details, and everything you start noticing more. The moments where there’s no dialogue and it’s just a bunch of different face expressions in multiple panels are what stood out to me as you can tell what the character’s thinking in that moment especially when Makima said she was going to kill Power.
7/9/2022 0:11:20	Chainsaw man was the first encounter I had with Tatsuki's work. On my first read, I really liked the story and characters since it was a wild ride to say the least. So It left a great impression on me as a fun, and crazy manga with a solid story, even with its more melancholic moments.
7/9/2022 0:12:10	Ngl I just started reading CSM cause I saw it literally everywhere and heard good things on it. But, honestly just thought at first it be a typical Shonen good guy fight bad guy nothing more nothing less etc. Even though its clearly more than that, I think at least. When I finished reading it, and this is just not exclusively CSM it goes for anything I find cool and have read/played/watched recently, I got obsessed and started to try anything similar. Overall, pretty neat almost failed an online class I think cause I was busy reading CSM.
7/9/2022 0:27:54	I never understood the hype for CSM, I mean it was decent but never thought that it's great. Maybe because when I was reading it there was no hype. It only had like 30 chapters I guess. The manga is fine. A one time read. But people are really crazy about it for some reason. I hoped that I would find the appeal for mangas like JjK and CSM but they are average at most. I would love to hear why they are so good for others.   Yea Fire punch was great!!
7/9/2022 1:28:50	First I want to say that I don’t write all this very well from English through Google translator.  For the first time I met him with the work "Fire punch" I will say that I have not read it to the end until now, but then "CM" came out and I read it in one gulp in full, I liked a lot of things, but then I started reading oneshots after CM was "Look Back" alone  of my favorite works of his later on, I have already read everything he did and I liked in his works the themes of art, life, family relationships, relationships between brothers and sisters, etc. You can also note his drawing style, I adore him very much  beautiful in places creepy, disgusting (in a good way), a couple even majestic and scary.  But what I would like from him, he probably won’t read it, but still, what would he continue to do manga like his oneshots or continue to do oneshots because I like all this, but the fact that I don’t want to see shonen-related CM is good of course especially  compared to other shounens but what i like most of Fujimoto's work is mostly in his oneshots more than in FP and CM.  I don’t want to write anything else, I think this is enough for you
7/9/2022 2:00:05	The first manga I read by Tatsuki Fugjimoto was chainsaw man and i had so much fun reading it and a major factor was it's so easy to read bythe lack of dialogue and more action.
7/9/2022 3:45:50	I first came across Chainsaw Man by seeing the panel of Denji saying that he really wants to touch some boobs, which I thought was funny enough to warrant me giving it a look. At first I just thought it was a dumb-fun entertaining enough manga. JJK if Yuji was horny basically.
7/9/2022 4:06:47	It was Chainsaw man, I originally read it because I wanted to try a manga with action in it but then after I did some research I got really hyped for the characters. Every singel character in chainsaw man is amazing. And then after I actually read it wow its beautifull. The Action is great, the story is beautifully written, The Art is fucking amazing, There is no filler chapter, I love it so much im so excited for Part 2 next week and I will definetly read his one shots once they come out as a physical release in germany 
7/9/2022 4:12:01	(I apologize in advance if I do make some grammar mistakes, but english is not my first language) My first impression of Fujimoto's work is quite strange to say the least. His only manga I read so far is CSM, and to be fair I am not too satisfied, maybe I was just expecting something different and/or better based on the attention and praise  it got online. Now, don't get me wrong, I do think some elements are praise worthy, for example Fujimoto does a splendid job with is paneling, which keeps the reader hooked page after page, or the art, that while having some problems really shines during fight scenes or some more "metaphysical" sceneries, and mostly the overall story, which distances itself from the usual Shonen Jump's works in both characters and graphic violence, while maintaining  a nice flow. The fast pacing of events the manga has in it's last volumes could be a turn off for some people, but personally I didn't really mind it. Now about what I didn't like, starting with the art. As I said fights are good, but on the other hand other scenes feel way too still and faces look almost all the same, with no real defining features. Another problem I have , and this is probably the most subjective one, is with comedic scenes, which sometimes take up entire pages to just make you smile awkwardly. Now, this might also have been the author's intent considering how goofy they look like, but I still did not like them. The last thing I didn't like about CSM is also, for me, the most important factor and it is that while reading the manga it didn't give me any particular feeling, and that kinda bored me. Great powers of the MC? Justified by "it's like that, deal with it". The revelation of who the "big bad guy" is? Wasn't really unexpected, but at least the character itself was probably the most interesting one. Character X close to MC dies? It happens in one panel and then you and the whole cast forget about it (with one exception I must admit), since you never grow any affection for them. Sometimes people die, sometimes they come back to life, any reason for that? Not really, it just happens. The ending is also quite tension free, as you have these two incredibly powerfull characters facing each other, but you already know that both will just keep coming back to life in case they die, until one of the two takes out a completely random deus ex machina (or two in this case) to end the fight. Oh, ok, so? So nothing, the manga ends telling you to stay tuned for part two. In the end was it worth reading? Maybe yes. It has many interesting elements, for how badly some may be mixed together, and acrion scenes are good. Am I looking forward to part 2? Not really. Will I read it? Probably yes, the manga has some good ideas and I would like it to reach A POINT in it's storytelling, and I would also like to see it expand on it's world lore, beyond it being only a plot device. Would I suggest CSM to a friend? Not really, at least for now. If part 2 resolves the problems I listed then yes, as I feel it has much to offer, but not as it is right now. In the end I belive CSM can be synthetized with cool, dumb and weird. I will in the future also try to read Fujimoto's other works, probably starting from Sayonara Eri and see if what I found in CSM is only the style the author wanted this manga to have, or if it is the approach he has when writing and drawing. - - - - - Also, SPOILERS AHEAD, there are two parts of the manga I actually appreciated almost entirely and those are the Reze arc, as for once we get a little time to grow affectionate to a character through Denji's eyes, which ends with a good build up fight and the assassins' arc that gives the reader a little insight on how the CSM world works outside of Japan and presents you with many characters and powers, still not contextualized but more forgiveable due to their sheer number. The assassins' arc also has the hell's chapters, which in my opinions are the best chapters of the wole manga by a wide margin, but the whole arc also ends in what is probably the most anticlimatic way possible.
7/9/2022 5:32:05	I came across CSM as my first manga of his. It was a mix of emotions from excitement at the amazing battle scenes, disgust and intrigue from some of the gore and sadness from some scenes. Overall, I think it is just incredible how a manga can make you feel so many emotions.
7/9/2022 5:50:08	İt was CSM and it was amazing. The fights were very well drawn and i loved the story. İ will check out other work drawn by Fujimoto. Keep up the good work man
7/9/2022 7:15:51	i think fujimoto art style describe how detailed and simple can be in the same time and i find absulutely suprise how detailed can be when it look so simple and his artstyle inspire me to draw also im waitng for CSM part 2 to come out. sorry for my bad english.
7/9/2022 8:09:52	I remember glancing at the beginning pages of Fire Punch and being introgued but not enough to read it. A friend recommended CSM and later Fire Punch, CSM I found really cool and dope, Fire Punch more on the weird and (the ending specifically) melancholic side, but still enjoyed a lot. (Except for the dog guy...)
7/9/2022 8:17:42	For me it was CSM. I started reading it in late 2020 cause a lot of ppl on youtube were making all these crazy memes about it and I wanted to know what this manga was all about. I went in without any expectations, and oh boy… that story was one crazy ride. The way of Fujimotos story telling was so unique, fucked up and in a way so honest(?), that it catched me completely off guard. I knew that this was going to become sth big after reading the first few chapters. CSM was definitely one of the best reading experiences I had in recent years.
7/9/2022 8:53:11	"Fuck I'm bored as hell and this one series is finished so why not. The art looks good and it's pretty hyped up too." Those were my first thoughts after reading Chainsaw Man, I found it to be apart of my top 3 favorite manga of all time! While I didn't like fire punch nearly as much his one shots were really fucking good. Like the nayuta one and his two recent ones were absolute bangers. The man has some serious genius and I'm absolutely excited for his next work (Chainsaw Man Part 2 Let's Go)! ((Reze best girl))
7/9/2022 10:18:36	(like most people) I first came across Tatsuki Fujimoto via CSM. The first read was definitely a mix of depression and confusion due to the way they’ve portrayed the tragedies that’ve occurred, but after another few reads (because it felt really refreshing to read it), the way Tatsuki Fujimoto uses the midst of all the gore and action to portray the true and genuine feelings of the characters (said feelings would usually sound cheesy and cringe if they were to be said in a normal setting)  is definitely something that etches this work into my mind as something amazing.
7/9/2022 12:05:59	Amazing
7/9/2022 12:08:20	Fire punch, actually it was my first manga. My first impression was "I like this" and then I readed all the manga in just 2 daysm felt a void inside me, I wanted more it was pretty weird but in a good way, it was amazing
7/9/2022 12:19:03	My first reaccion was like damn manga can be better than anime 🦁
7/9/2022 12:47:54	Fire punch, I loved FP. It was a great deconstruction of tropes in manga. As well as top notch world building and characterization. I read chainsaw man afterwards and was ultimately disappointed
7/9/2022 12:54:17	For me it was chainsaw Man it was phenomenal, I could never guess what was gonna happen next and that's what I love most in a story. it had me on left and right on how much I loved each character. After CSM I read fire punch and wow the ending was so satisfying more than any other manga I've ever read. all of Tatsuki Fujimotos one shots are the best none of them have failed me. 
7/9/2022 14:38:16	When I first saw chainsaw man I was initially disappointed with things like the mc and his goals but after I started it again and read the katana man arc I was hooked and loved everything he’s made since and can’t wait for the one shot and part 2
7/9/2022 15:54:07	CSM dumb, weird and garbage
7/9/2022 16:54:21	the first manga i read by fujimoto was csm, it was weird funny and definitely amazing. 
7/9/2022 17:24:36	i dont speak english, but your videos are great! read Bibliomania guys
7/9/2022 18:14:47	First I read was CSM, then fire punch, but the work that really stuck with me out of everything he's made was Goodbye Eri. The manga was a literal logical and emotional roller coaster, leaving anyone wondering if and if not. It left room for many interpretations depending on the  perspective of the person reading, which I absolutely loved. I don't remember the last time I cried reading anything, but there was just something about this one-shot. Also... its wack and spells Tatsuki Fujimoto. I wonder wtf was going on in his head when he came up with this. This isn't really a first impression, but uuuuuhhhh.... yeah, love the fact that it's the picture I see here on Google docs, lol. Nice touch.  
7/9/2022 19:21:02	I was not really into reading manga at the time, I used to only watch anime but one day i just couldn't find a decent anime to watch so I remembered a friend of mine telling me that if I wanted to start to read manga I had to by reading chainsaw man. I had also seen other people online saying that csm was a masterpiece so I started to read, as I began reading first I had no idea how to read a manga and nobody told me the way you had to, so i was pretty confused and I found the story extremely boring and weird. Some time later I gave mangas one other chance by reading another famous manga called Berserk and I absolutely loved it, after finished reading it I came back to chainsaw man and to this day is my favourite manga. I realized that it was not the story the problem but me not being used to read in general and mostly not being used to the silence around when you read. When I started reading fire punch I got really excited seeing the same art style as csm but I got pretty disappointed because I didn't really like the story,  I was expecting the same level as csm but it felt underwhelming.
7/9/2022 19:56:17	I started with Chainsaw Man like a lot of people and my first reaction to his works I feel like could be described with a single word, drugs, because I swear he had to be taking some when writing a series like Chainsaw Man or Fire Punch. To me it felt like Tatsuki Fujimoto was a guy who was addicted to drugs and hung out with the boys in the dumpster behind a burger king and the first thing that came into their minds is what they put into the next chapter and this is honestly how I felt about him when I first read through Chainsaw Man but yet despite that it also felt like this man was a literary genius. Still, after I've read most of his works still have the same opinion on this dude as I did when I first read one of his works which is "this guy's got a few too many screws loose." 
7/9/2022 20:13:05	damn…
7/9/2022 20:33:29	CSM, and I’m not entirely sure what I thought of it. All I knew was that when I finished reading, I knew I had just finished reading a masterpiece.
7/9/2022 20:46:06	csm i read the first few chapters, thought it was a little too weird for me, dropped it for a few months, then blitzed it all in one sitting. absolutely loved it and have been a fan ever since i thought the bizarre nature of everything going on in the story while not taking itself insanely seriously was a really important quality when it came to me enjoying it. same goes for when i read eri and fire punch
7/9/2022 22:28:09	It was chainsaw man. It was amazing, the pacing,the storytelling, the art,the characters,the screenplay, everything man .. it is just perfect. Coming to one shots, oh boy isn't he good at one shots. One shots of fujimoto is way better than some whole manga series .
7/9/2022 22:53:53	i just binge read csm in a couple days and enjoyed it in a turn-off-your-brain kinda way, until the last few chapters. that was when i realized i had no clue wtf was going on, but was also really shaken up by what happened in the last arc. it's been around a year since i read it, and the only part i really remember vividly was that final arc. that basically sums up my view on csm, it was mostly mid tier until the ending which blew my mind (i wonder what that's a reference to...). haven't read Fire Punch or the one shot, but i might check them out because 1. there's that one funny manga panel in Fire Punch and 2. i heard the one shot was sad as hell, so i wanna experience some more of that after finishing The Horizon (my favourite recommendation from your reading 30 manga recs video)
7/9/2022 23:31:26	I first read chainsaw. And the i think it was awesome, there was so many cool western films references that i catched, the characters where really likeable and the story was so weird it was funny. I have read almost everything he wrote and i buy every manga that gets published on Argentina
7/9/2022 23:53:02	The first piece of work that I saw of fujimotos was CSM and I binge read it in only 2 days and it has become one of my favorite mangas of all time and also got me into reading Mangas in the first place. Everything about the story, art style and characters kept me intrigued and wanting more from it. Not long after I read fire punch and enjoyed it just as much as CSM. I wholeheartedly believe that fujimoto is one of the best mangakas out there.
7/9/2022 23:58:05	the first thing I read by Fujimoto was Fire Punch (shortly before reading CSM). A friend had recommended it to me, and I thought Fire Punch was amazing- definitely a great manga and severely underrated. The ending was a little lacking to me but it did its job of fulfilling the story, and it was a little weird at times but I love that weirdness in Fujimoto’s work, its part of what sets him apart from others.
7/10/2022 0:09:21	unique. opened up my imagination. very easy to read feels like youre watching a movie. absurd but in  the best way possible. 
7/10/2022 0:26:39	I forget where I first heard of it, but I read fire punch years ago and honestly fell in love. I was so thankful that fujimoto kept his same sense of absurd endings with chainsaw man. Both were very satisfying reads.
7/10/2022 0:55:38	Was searching through manga and found csm, I thought the story was okay, but the art style definitely intrigued me.
7/10/2022 1:35:32	Really weird and really really cool. I’ve read tons of manga and none gives the same energy as any of tatsukis work. I started myself with fire punch and read CSM afterwards. Loved both even tho my heart got fucked by fire punchs ending
7/10/2022 1:51:16	It was Chainsaw Man at first I thought this would be a basic horror shine but it blew my mind in so many ways. Fujimoto really made an absolute banger
7/10/2022 2:17:24	Csm I thought it was amazing 
7/10/2022 3:05:06	csm was my first read of fujimoto’s works and now my favorite manga. It covers a lot of themes but I thought it was balls dropping awesome.
7/10/2022 3:27:38	Fire Punch, thought it was a total masterpiece once I hit the end sections. Still regard it as one of the best short manga of all time.
7/10/2022 4:08:48	The first manga by Fujimoto that I've read is CSM, and my first impression is that it was "different". The artstyle, plot, and characters were all special and unique compared to other shonens or manga in general. I've also read Fire Punch after reading CSM because of how much I liked the author's style, and Fire Punch has become one of my favorite manga because of its characters and its comedic and philosophical plot.
7/10/2022 4:24:45	Fire punch and that was certainly special!
7/10/2022 4:29:33	My first fujimoto manga was fire puch Which at first i thought was end but by the end it got very weird which is exactly i why I love it. CSM was a bit less enjoying as I got spoilers but goodbye eri was definitely his best work.
7/10/2022 6:31:06	Short answers: Hanging out with my brother and a friend in bookstores. We were supposed to watch a movie and go to the arcade, but we just went shopping for books like some f*Clin nerds. He's specifically looking for CSM, Vol. 1. This piqued my interest. TBH, him and I have a shared interest in anime, but I'm not really into manga. TBmoreH, I pick up stuff here and there to keep idle chitchat and BS my way through the rest. Anyway with manga, can't really afford to or whatever. A week or so later, found out about a certain app from another friend that lets me read comic's, but primarily manga for *cough cough* a certain price. Definitely not free. So I'm chilling on there, reading mostly comicbooks and remember my friend (that me and my brother were hanging out with) gushing over how good CSM was and decided to dip my toes. Read the first chapter and that was interesting... to say the least. Left it for about a month and when I came back to it... I frickin sprinted through that thing. Mind you, this is my first official introduction to the world of manga and was loving EVERY FRICKIN MINUTE of it. As I mentioned before, I do watch anime and generally know what I'm getting into with anything relating to it. I recognise Denji isn't your typical protagonist. His motivation are not abstract or idealistic. It's a day-to-day kinda struggle. Like food and a warm bed or kissing a girl. If you come from that particular background or have any semblance of what poverty is like, it really hit close to home. Getting further into it, just the concept on it's own is fascinating. Like any other medium, it really comes into it's own as the story progresses. The action is really impeccable. The fight scenes have bite to them. And the power's are just so cool. Like watching Ben 10 or Spiderman as a hit level's of nutty. But simultaneously, the deep emotional core (I have cried SO much, I cry a lot though so...) and the character's stick with you. It's got a big twist. There are moments that are outright hilarious and shocking, like Denji's first kiss, for example. It has this action/horror exterior, with balls-to-the-wall massive, killer action, a strong & beautiful heart, gut busting and gut wrenching moments and an ending that had me a little shaken and a little confused (but not the clueless kinda confused, if you know what I mean). I finished all 100 and something chapter's in about, two week's. So yeah, it was alright for my first time. Recommended it for my brother and waiting in striking anticipation for the anime. 0/10. Would do it again... Long answer: Yes. (Editor's Note: At the time of writing this, the author was experiencing opposite day in Africa) (Author's Note: The editor is literally me. Just wanted to also mention, I nearly lost this frickin note and had a quick panic attack accompanying that, but managed to recovery the above) Also love the work, got some excellent recommendations from you. Thank you.
7/10/2022 6:34:20	So here's my thoughts oversimplified.  Read Mangas/Oneshot: Goodbye Eri, Look Back and Fire Punch.  First Manga: Fire Punch Favorite Manga: Look Back  Thoughts about Fire Punch (Since its my first one)  Story - (6/10) Good ideas and concepts about enemies and threats with no actual real ones, though it felt shocking and not that well delivered or set up. But felt rushed and incomplete and escalated in a direction I did like, but felt little to no substance and wished they were more characters I cared about Togata.  Art - (8.5/10) Great, Fujimoto has certainly a similiar yet distinct enough artsyle that could seperate itself as an author. (Atleast IMO) To which his artsyle I can only boil down to "It gives a feeling of intimacy, rawness, beauty with enough being detailed but still has the maintains the minimalist of a manga."  Character (5.5/10)- The main mc was fine no real complaints except for being no cap incensious. The best character in the manga has to be Togata as I find her both to be interesting and compelling character as a companion and superior? Or teacher? But I like how she played out as some OP random girl that eventually felt fucked up and nihilistic chatacter that suits the world of the manga. While the other felt just filler characters there some minor characters that could have or did played major roles though I felt little to no attachment, interest or no recalling memories of standing out that much, this part lf the  manga is probs the weakest one.  Final Thoughts - 6.5/10 I find the manga's story to be quite intereting and intriguing as I could easily find some aspects of Berserk and Vinland Saga in this manga but in comparison just feels nothing more than a cheap attempt for it to be like those masterpieces. But I feel saddened for the potential It really had to be a good or even a great manga.
7/10/2022 6:39:04	My first Tatsuki Fujimoto manga was Fire Punch. I remember thinking that he has a very unique style of story telling and some interesting manga paneling. I also had no idea where the story was going for most of the manga. I don't know if I'd consider Fire Punch a good story tbh but it definitely made me think about a lot of existential questions, especially after finishing it. It also made me laugh a couple of times throughout the story, which is more than most manga I read. So I guess it was pretty funny too.
7/10/2022 6:56:27	The first time that I read one of Fujimoto’s works was during the early chapters of Chainsaw Man, and I was like what the fuck, this is is good as hell. I ended up reading Fire Punch, and concluded that it was edgy, over-the-top, dark, and funny, in a good way. The sequence where Togata gets shot while trying to smoke is fucking amazing. 
7/10/2022 7:29:14	My first exposure to Fujimoto was CSM. The first time through, the interesting themes pretty much flew over my head as I gasped in awe at how insane and different the characters were, how brutal the plot got and how great the artstyle was. I think CSM gave me a suit fetish
7/10/2022 8:31:38	I first read csm and i absolutely loved it. The brutal art and story really solidified my love for that type of manga. I am really excited for the release of part 2 chapter one this week
7/10/2022 9:21:19	I think I was intrigued by the cover and that title of chainsaw man. Art looked cool and the chainsaw head stood out. No guns no life stood out to me more though despite them having similar covers. I think the reason I actually read chainsaw man first was because there were people talking about it.
7/10/2022 9:31:51	Csm
7/10/2022 10:04:29	I read Chainsaw Man and jizzed my pants. What an incredible, chaotic piece of art.
7/10/2022 11:30:57	It was a breath of fresh air. I’m P desensitized to gore and all that but CSM had so much more in it than I was prepared to witness. The tonal balance is what shocked me most. How can something so schlocky on the surface have so much emotional depth and nuance underneath? It makes me wonder what kind of person Fujimoto-San is. For a while I’ve felt a shift in the manga/anime space and now I know for a fact it is due to works like CSM and Jujutsu Kaisen. It’s a great time to be a fan of Japanese works 😊
7/10/2022 12:17:30	I first found out about Fujimoto when Chainsaw Man was around 30 chapters and got the first 11 chapters I thought it was just a cool, funny manga. then I read chapter 12, about Denji having an existential crisis over the chasing of goals vs actually achieving them all because of boobs and it’s so immature but such a genuine depiction of something we all realize at some point. I just had this wave of understanding crash into me, Tatsuki Fujimoto isn’t some boring mangaka out for fame or money, he really cares about the details and motivation which was further shown by other equally great moments throughout Chainsaw Man. In conclusion Chainsaw Man is wild, profound and sick as fuck, Fire Punch is absurd, upsetting and meaningful and all his oneshots are crazy and beautiful both in art and intent.
7/10/2022 13:41:36	The first work of his that I read was chainsaw man. When I first started reading manga, my friend recommended it to me (late 2020), telling me it was really good so I decided to read it on my phone. I thought it was well drawn and that it was an interesting idea, but I couldn’t really follow the story and I didn’t really think about much after I was done reading.  However, I recently bought the whole series to try and read it again and pay more attention to the details of the story and it’s fucking amazing. 
7/10/2022 13:49:58	Fire punch, it was weird and amazing, I loved the theme
7/10/2022 13:55:45	For me it was chainsaw man. And tbh I've never really had that much fun reading a manga, it's fast paced + something about his art style is just really amazing idk how to describe it properly. Its one of my fav mangas now. It made me want to read more if his works too.
7/10/2022 15:23:46	Gritty, off the wall excitement that made me laugh and cry
7/10/2022 15:38:38	It was csm and it was depressing at the beginning then funny .. i don't know how to describe it but the mood for csm is always changing always has it's high peaks then falls right after , one panel everyone is happy then the panel after that everyone is probably dead or lost a vital body part ... overall csm was a unique experience to me as I'm not used to read mangas that easily change it's course of action like killing characters easily , also my favourite csm character is beam love his enthusiasm so much
7/10/2022 16:26:34	1. Chainsaw man 2. What the fuck did i just read  3. Cool but what the fuck did i just read  4. Yeah nice but what the fuck did i just read 
7/10/2022 17:26:21	I heard about Chainsaw man first, loved it, read fire punch, loved it, even though I’m a bit more conflicted on it. And I’ve been meaning to read his one shots for a while now. I thought chainsaw man was fun, rad as shit, and an overall amazing read. Fire punch I thought was super cool (no pun intended), very much so a different vibe, and very very melancholic. I’ve loved both his major works, even though they aren’t the MOST profound thing I’ve read. Love his art style, and can’t wait to see what comes next for Chainsaw man.
7/10/2022 17:51:37	CSM
7/10/2022 17:52:36	Found this fujimoto dude way back when Fire Punch was still on going.The first thing i thought of after reading it was “What kind of weirdo could possibly come up with these plots”. Fire Punch didn't really shine to me that much but it there in my mind to remind me there's this dude that drew a fire man holding a head chasing a girl by the beach. After a while CSM got released . Everything hit my spot literally on the first chapter.The transformation , devils , kiss puke and everything go brrr . Its a never ending fiesta , i never read something like that b4 and it's amazing. Fujimoto sensei's work might not be appealing to most people but it definitely got much better from fire punch to CSM . CSM is basically his iconic manga now, Look Back , Goodbye,Eri and the recent Just listen to the song are also great . Hope it goes well on the second part and hopefully see more weird shit from him.
7/10/2022 18:03:53	my first, I think it was fire puch but only the first 10ch and then I stoped after a while I read chainsaw man and it was a rollercoaster of a ride that actually felt nice especially the puke page 😔rip denjis taste buds the more I read I felt the same as the mc but at some point I just stoped having feelings nothing every one that I loved died(in the manga) and I felt nothin just empty ness just the same as the mc at the end of the read. After a while I continued fire punch and I regret reading it, it messed up my mind the compleat bullshit that he can come up with it felt not a normal manga and the story is very I don't know , the mc forgets and has ADHD and man the ending was weird as hell but hey it was a good read, both were a good read but I prefer chainsaw man more its more of a story than a manga built up by random emotions and 
7/10/2022 18:18:38	Just fucking weird I can't really say anything else 😂
7/10/2022 20:49:13	It was the one shot look back and I really liked it and then I immediately read goodbye eri and absolutely loved that 
7/10/2022 22:19:14	I came across CSM and it was Amazing! You could tell that the author put his soul into the work and I don't even know how he came up with half of the stuff. It was a nice read, it was cool but also weird at times. 
7/11/2022 0:15:53	Best modern mangka period. Every piece of his work tells a story that is so enticing I get wrapped into instantly. CSM was my first manga of his and I finished it in a few days just to appreciate it more, but then with fire punch not even an afternoon and I was done. Work after work I got more enthralled in what I could wanting to consume more, but alas it ended. Fujimoto tells a story in such a unique way that no other author does and it shows in how his assistants went on to write their own manga.
7/11/2022 1:11:00	First found fire punch, thought it was cool for a while until... they started making a movie or smth? it's been so long so idk but it just fell of and i dropped it.
7/11/2022 1:41:05	Chainsaw Man
7/11/2022 1:47:27	My first work of his was fire punch. After I finished reading it I felt mind fucked af. It fucking shot up my rankings I thought it was so good. Although after thinking back a little I think the last 50 chapters were a clustefuck of ideas. But I do think the first 50 or so chapters were absolutely amazing 
7/11/2022 2:20:01	CSM, later on sayonara eri and now reading fire punch.  Me personally, I do think this author is capable of amazing things, however his past work has not been as good as everyone hypes it out to be. 
7/11/2022 2:20:23	it was CSM, it remains one of my favorite manga of all time. i was honestly shocked at how good the line work became after a couple of chapters. the comedy was like nothing i’ve seen before in japanese media. chainsaw man will always be one of my favorite mangas. the twists and turns really kept me hooked and saying “one more chapter then i sleep” i really like it, cant wait for the anime to come out.
7/11/2022 2:53:51	Fire Punch, I loved it so much I had to check out his other works, then I found out he made chainsawman, loved that even more, and now I've read everything 
7/11/2022 3:11:10	Like most people presumably , I first read chainsaw man when it first entered the jump lineup. Read the whole way through but i didn’t get it and why it had such a big cult following. The art and gore was great but i really didn't get the plot. I still don’t really get it despite the couple videos i watched it afterwards. Maybe because its segmented like Jojo’s bizarre adventure. Maybe you don't have to understand what’s going on to appreciate and revere it. Just like a cult. Ive now read most of their work to date and i believe that Goodbye, Eri was the best one I've seen so far. Cant wait for CSM part 2 in a couple days. Fujimoto is also a really good soul emptier.
7/11/2022 3:18:45	Cool 
7/11/2022 3:35:54	The first manga I read by tatsuki fujimoto was chainsaw man and the first chapter was just straight up cool and got me hooked to the story, it did start getting weird as hell as I continued to read but it didn't turn me off in fact it made the manga more interesting in my opinion.
7/11/2022 6:04:04	So first encounter everyone cums about chainsaw man. Then i just first had stepped up to the world of manga so it was my second manga to ever read. It WAS BALLISTIC, BOMBASTIC, BUSTY ,BODACIOUS AND BUTT FUCK WILD. Did i understand its fucking underlying messages hell no... did i love power hell no .... did i enjoy the fuck out of this manga hellll yeaaaaa... Yea thats the entire experience reading any of fujimotos works.Recalling fire punch .... WOW WHAT A GREAT OPENING.. then hmm is this incest or oh no wait they just had sex ... HMM WHAT THE FUCK .. Fujimotos a mad man i find him quirky and just unhinged and always unexpecting. SO i think fujimotos a cycle of picking up his work thinking HMMM WHAT.. then ..HMM THATS GOOD ...HMM OH NOW THEY ARE IN SPACE WITH A GIANT HORSE COCK. IDK ranted too long . Hyped for csm pt2
7/11/2022 6:23:46	I was really surprised, it's was chainsaw man. I picked it up because it look fun (and for sure it's loads of fun), but didn't expect how heartfelt and emotional it was. I think chainsaw man became instantly one of my top 3 after the third volume. Quick rec if you don't know about it already but you should for sure read dorohero and Q. HAYASHIDA's work ! Have a great day ! 
7/11/2022 8:24:31	I've read only Goodbye Eri and abit of CSM. Goodbye eri was honestly very brillant, it constantly defies your expectation. you feel like you know what happened only to later find out you dont know whats real and in the end you feel like you might not know anything. The artsyle of fujimoto is always very refreshing and different from the usual manga style, you never get bored reading through it.
7/11/2022 8:49:50	I was honestly weirded out CSM didnt follow traditional shown jump tropes.CSM is the type of manga that fuck your dad in the living and makes you watch as it tickles his ballsack
7/11/2022 9:22:45	I came across Fire Punch before CSM. I thought the story was a little weird a first but i honestly couldnt stop reading.
7/11/2022 9:56:33	CSM 
7/11/2022 10:21:41	I first read fire punch and loved it, it had amazing art, an engaging plot and loveable characters that were developed through gritty themes. I also liked the inclusion of a trans character, especially that it was not dwelled on so much, rather just another part of their character.  I read chainsaw man afterwards and thoroughly enjoyed it as well, with the same beautiful visuals and more fights. Fujimoto is probably my favourite mangaka. The oneshots also slapped.
7/11/2022 10:26:23	Goodbye Eri was really amazing story telling
7/11/2022 10:35:50	It was chainsaw man and I thought but was an insanely cool story with art to match and some genuinely good humor
7/11/2022 11:11:40	it was csm, i thought the art was cool but i couldn’t really get into it at first, then a couple months later i started it again and i loved it.
7/11/2022 11:29:22	My first and only read of tatsuki fugimoto was chainsaw man   It was a fun to read exciting and was like a superhero thing but it's ending was so so sad for me because it was my one of the earliest mangas I've read   I think that csm was a amazing read,actually at that time I was new to the anime community so I didn't thought that reading any manga can be this amazing
7/11/2022 11:45:40	First was CSM and I found it weird af first but then it quickly became cool 
7/11/2022 12:18:57	So far I read CSM and the one-shot Goodbye Eri
7/11/2022 12:36:13	It was Chainsaw man and I thought at first it was Cool but very different for other WSJ titles 
7/11/2022 13:27:20	it was CSM, and i was absolutely floored. i was expecting another somewhat generic shonen with a fun theme but was greeted with some of the most professional and creative artwork, panelling and storytelling i’ve ever come across in manga. an amazing read that kept me on the edge of my seat for its duration. 
7/11/2022 23:56:53	CSM i thought it was shocking but funny in a way but also it felt real as fuck
7/12/2022 6:01:48	At first my friend sent me a panel of mummy makima and the astronauts panel from CSM, so my first impressions where holy fuck, where do I find this. I found everything about CSM, the art, the story, the small details, the holy fuck moments, the creativity, just amazing. I pulled an all-nighter the day I started just because he had told me over discord after work because he just finished this cool manga that’s “like JJK” and I could not sleep until I finished and researched everything I could find on the internet that had the term “chainsaw man” in it, re watch the trailer, go through reddit, find anything Tatsuki Fujimoto had about the series. Only two other story’s I have experienced have been like CSM to the point where it prevented my daily functions for days because I could not stop my brain from thinking about what I had just experienced, the only thing to fill the void that I seemed to now have was to just watch everything video on youtube until there was no more, read all the reddit threads until there no more so re-read the story, twice. Still breath taking. 
7/12/2022 8:38:39	CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN CHAINSAWMAN VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRVRVRVRVBRVR. It was an acid trip
7/12/2022 13:17:44	My first run-in with Fujimoto was Chainsaw Man when I randomly downloaded the Shonen Jump app and saw it, and it piqued my interest. I didn't have the subscription at the time and it was at around chapter 60 or 70 so I was only able to read the first three chapters, but I loved it immediately. Later on I started collecting the physical English volumes to read it and I continued to love. But once I found out there were websites where I could actually read manga on, I got impatient on waiting for the volumes and I read the rest online once it ended and it was one of the craziest things I've read. I've been an avid fan of Fujimoto ever since, having read a majority of what he's made and I continue to read whatever he produces. 
7/13/2022 16:18:05	I forgot something to say but I already made a survey submission *(I recommended Usogui and burn notice and all the other shows along with talking about my life going downhill and how no one talks to me along with people ignoring me so I can't talk to them and then how I have many story ideas)* anyways I just thought you should make a discord server and that my discord username and tag is (Nickylosex #1880) thats for if you want to hear any ideas or need any songs or manga/show recommendations and I don't think I mentioned the fact that chainsawman brings me joy (I tried commenting on your recent post to but my comments got deleted) and there's a video called "makima vs darkness devil" and hopefully that'll add to your video on Tatsuki Fujimoto's work (it's a cool animation with a great song which is gravechill's"twilight") also you should use the Mario strikers charged pause music in your videos (the best elevator music that a lot of YouTubers use) anyways I hope this gets to you and that you read my other submission but please reach out so I can at least talk to someone until then Stay blessed 
7/13/2022 20:02:01	I heard of Chainsaw Man very early. Didn't know what it was. Eventually collected all the volumes and found out about Fire Punch. I have yet to read a one-shot, since they are very long and dissapear quite quickly from MangaPlus.
7/13/2022 21:27:22	Chainsaw Man, didn't want to read it at first because Makima simps on twitter gave me a bad first impression, then I realized it's the kind of unadulterated, nonsensical violence I love and picked up the manga after watching Scamboli Reviews' video on it.
7/13/2022 23:52:39	Weirdly addictive

7/21/2022 10:13:23	it was hella different and weird compared to other mangas but really refreshing. it was fire punch the first i read. i loved it but the end was a little too strange and anticlinatic for my taste but a good ending nevertheless
7/24/2022 18:20:25	ITS PUUUUKE fuking awesome
7/25/2022 22:09:43	csm, 10/10 best manga i've ever read
7/26/2022 9:42:53	I read Fire Punch first, got to a scene with implied child SA and dropped it for like a year before coming back after reading CSM
7/30/2022 5:25:27	Csm. I thought it was raw as fuck. Coming straight off the back of jjk with that edgier unrefined sketchy but incredibly effective stye of art this was just a treat. It was crude and different. Something about the way he approaches scenes was really intriguing. Of course there's plenty of kick ass moments depicting fast and hard hitting action but at the same time he manages to create an illustration of the most pivotal point of movement and freeze frame it. Has all the action of a kick with all the beauty of a paintin. And then I read the one shots and it was like seeing a whole other side of him. Quiet. Introspective and smart paneling of a camera filming someone's life. It was refreshing. Have yet to get to fire punch but I hear some think it's better than csm

11/28/2022 21:58:42	I love u sir. ur so amazing and hot and i legitimately wish u could be my first boyfriend.  anyways thats normal haha  i love chainsaw man. I came across Tatsuki through chainsaw man and i remember laughing so fucking hard at denji selling his ball (??) I strangely wasn't super fazed at the whole "i wanna touch some boobies thing" (i would let denji touch my boobs out of pity tbh) but probably because i watched and read food wars before, so that kinda messed my view of naked people up. i was just really confused and was like WTF DID I READ??? cause that was insane.. i feel like tatsuki must be insane to some extent to be able to portray insane ppl in that way... anyways ily
